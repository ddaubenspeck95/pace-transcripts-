 So Rubin Dominguez comes to me and goes, hey, Pace, I need $6,000 and I need to cover my payroll on Friday. I go, okay, well, how much would you pay me an interest? He goes, well, if I can hold that $6,000 until Monday, I'll pay you $3,000 return. So essentially paying me nine grand, $6,000 to cover my loan and $3,000 return. Guys, that's a 50% return in literally a weekend. That's $3,000 and I'm like, damn. All right. So that's gator lending, okay? That's gator lending, helping bringing a resource to people, not charging interest, but taking a chunk, right? Chomp, chomp, chomp, chomp, gator lending, taking a chunk. So I did this for probably a good year with Rubin and then Rubin got on his feet and I would make sometimes three grand in a weekend, five grand in a weekend. I'm like, dude, this is amazing. In fact, I paid for my wedding. I paid for my wedding with part of this. Okay. So anyway, I obviously I wasn't a real estate investor 11, 12 years ago. So I was just doing gator lending without ever it being called gator lending. I just made that name up 90 days ago. Okay. I made that up 90 days ago, but I'd been doing it for 11 years. Then when I got into real estate, I started getting wholesalers coming to me and saying, pace, I don't have earnest money for a transaction. Does anybody not know what earnest money is? Ernest money is when you get into a contract with a seller, right? You and the seller get into a contract. The contract is going to show. In fact, I could pull it up today right now. I could pull it up on the document I'm going to give you guys.

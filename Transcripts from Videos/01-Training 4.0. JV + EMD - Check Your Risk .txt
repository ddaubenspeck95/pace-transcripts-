 Thank you guys for being patient through all of that. I really do appreciate it. I know last week there were a handful of people like I want to get started and one of those people is Heather Whitsig who has already very proud of her. She's one of my action taking students and sub two as well. So I wanted to bring her on here. Say hello to this amazing human being Heather Whitsig. How you doing? Hey everyone. Hey, hey. So Heather, just for everybody in there, what do you currently have going on in terms of opportunities from Gator lending or in and then let's talk about because one of the top questions people are going to get are how did you find them? Yeah. So I am starting to do a little TC work for a group of wholesalers actually in sub two. So I'm actually doing some of that starting, you know, last week after we got back from Vegas. So I met them in Vegas and they started, they were kind of asking around if anybody wanted to do some EMD for some of their deals. And so I've got two, well EMD for one portfolio that I am going to be lending on and then another portfolio that I'm partially lending a down payment on. And then I found somebody else to come in the rest of the down payment. So I'm kind of doing like a broker fee for that as well. Yep, you're doing what I call Gator wrestling. Yes, Gator wrestling. And I'm sure that now. So, you know, it's perfect. So a couple of things for you guys transaction coordinator for any of you, any of the sub two students that are in here, you guys don't have a clue what we are building for you right now. We are building a full on transaction coordination. I would say many course, but it's not many. It's it will end up actually being larger than the actual sub two and seller finance course that you already have access to. We are building a full on transactional like training series. I do about that. Yeah. It's so amazing. And here's, here's the reason for that is because a lot of people have wives. That's typically the demographic I apologize for people are like, well, what about my husband and what about my what I'm a woman and I have a wife and I'm a lesbian and you're not including me. Yes, I am. You're all included. Stop, stop making me choose. I don't want to say the same sentence five different times. Just let me say it in a very general way. Please. So I'm creating. Gabriella says, how can I be part of that? Be a sub two student. All sub two students will have access to this and the advantage of being a transaction coordinator is a handful of things. Okay. You will see transactions before anybody else gets to see transactions because what's happening is the wholesalers in the world and the investors of the world go to somebody like a Heather Witzig who was not a transaction coordinator months ago. She's learned that in sub two and she's been around other TCs and it's something that she's recently adopted as something that she can do on a daily basis to earn active income without actually having to be the person that goes out and finds deals. So in sub two, Caleb Christopher, my transaction coordinator, Rachel, somebody who is my newly hired gal that I would call our syllabus creator and coordinator. We are putting together an entire training for you investors out there that have wives or significant others for that matter saying, how can I be a part of your business? How can I help you in your endeavor? I don't have the ability to cold call and I don't have the ability to negotiate and I don't have the ability to do all these types of things, but I'm smart and I can get my hands dirty. Well, we're teaching your wife, your significant other, how to become a transaction coordinator, not only for your transactions, but for other transactions of other wholesalers in your general area or for other sub two students. I imagine Heather, once you joined sub two, you're like, holy crap, everything I ever wanted and needed is inside of this community. I learned how to be a transaction coordinator. I get business from sub two students that need me to be their transaction coordinator. I get other students that need me to lend the money to them on the earnest money. Oh my gosh, Paces built an entire business for me essentially. Obviously you put the action in. Paces created a platform for me that I can get any resource I want by just simply taking action and you don't even have to be the one cold calling texting, negotiating, spending the money, doing any of that kind of stuff. It is the greatest place on planet earth. So to answer that question for you guys that say, well, how did Heather find these deals? Guys, she learned how to be a transaction coordinator in my mentorship in sub two, being around other transaction coordinators in my mentorship in sub two. She then provided value by letting people hire her as their transaction coordinator. And the greatest part of being a transaction coordinator is not the fee that you charge. It's the opportunity you are faced with when you are handling somebody else's transaction. Yeah. And just learning the contracts and being able to do it when I start wholesaling myself one day, you know, so what does a transaction coordinator do? Here's what a transaction coordinator does. Everything. Make sure everything gets closed. No, no, no, no, you do not, you we got to not simplify this. Let's, let's give this some breath for five minutes. Let me explain to you what a transaction coordinator is. Are you ready to hear what a transaction coordinator is? Yes. A transaction coordinator will take your success rate of let's go say the average wholesaler will sign 10 contracts and about three or four of them close, meaning they actually come to fruition. They get paid on them. The other seven, six or seven of them cancel for a variety of reasons. One of the biggest reasons is lack of communication between all the parties. Okay. So the transaction coordinator, you would think the title company, anybody ever in here think, wow, this title company sucks. They don't communicate. They're overwhelmed. Okay. Anybody ever been in a real estate transaction? Your title company and your escrow officers are not your babysitter. Their job is to do the paperwork associated with the transaction. However, they get busy. Their business models who do as many transactions as they possibly can in a monthly basis and where sometimes there's persistent, persistent required to let's say I'm buying a house from a seller and my lender, I have a lender involved that's bringing money to the table. Well, typically a title company supposed to call the bank of the seller and say, what's the payoff? They get that payoff. They bring it to title. They put in the paperwork. Then their job is to go to the lender and go, hey, here's the payoff. Pace needs to borrow this much money, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. There's so much coordination that goes on behind all of this. And the reality is I'd say more than half of the phone calls, half of the emails, half of the text messages that you as an investor are sending out don't get, get replied to for two to 12 hours. And so a transaction coordinator is the person that's making sure that you, they are staying on top of the communication. They're looking through the documents. Our transaction coordinator actually gets on the phone with our seller when we're getting a house under contract and walks our sellers through the contract. So we don't have to. So I can say, hey, all right, sounds great, Mrs. Seller. We're going to have Allison or one of our other transaction coordinators call you and walk you through the paperwork. And then the transaction coordinator gets the receipt of the earnest money, sends it to the seller. They basically allow us to completely disconnect from the seller and the relationship with the seller so that we can move on and go get another contract if you're a wholesaler, okay? Or go raise money if you're an investor or, you know, go get another listing if you're an agent. Transaction coordinators are, they've been in the business for a hundred years. They're everywhere. Typically they're not well known because they usually handle about five to 20 transactions a month. And they kind of just work in one little real estate brokerage or whatever else. They're one of the unsung heroes of the real estate world and very few people actually know who they are. They are very critical. I would never start a real estate business without outsourcing to a transaction coordinator because I don't want to deal with all the crap. It's a lot. It is so many times when a seller's in foreclosure, the average amount of time you have to wait on hold in order to get through to the right people to talk to is about six hours. So a lot of times I'll walk into a transaction coordinator's office and they'll sit they'll be sitting on hold on two different phones with two different transactions, answering emails, doing face time with people, doing all sorts of stuff. Transaction coordinator takes your success rate from three or four contracts closed if you're a whole seller all the way up to closer to six contracts if you're a whole seller. So they double your success rate of your closed transactions based on being the glue between all of the parties. The seller starts getting weird or wishy-washy or whatever and they need somebody to calm them down. Maybe there's a buyer that's losing some sort of you know patience or whatever else. The transaction coordinator is to keep their job is to keep the transaction on the right track all the way until everybody gets paid. Has that sufficiently answered what a transaction coordinator is guys you will hear this so many stinking times. Okay. If you have not written down what's a transaction coordinator in the future if you guys ask me what is a transaction coordinator I will reference back to Gator lending 4.0 until you go rewatch the video. I will not explain it to you in greater detail than what I just did. Okay. Now you will also learn sub two students you know I don't normally talk this way or I'm not this quick usually I'll give that 45 minutes of breath and I'll walk through a whiteboard video but I'm not here to train anybody on how to become a transaction coordinator. In sub two you guys can come in and ask me any question and I will answer it regardless of what the question is except I did bark at Heather last night for asking me Gator lending zoom quite or Gator lending stuff because I was like I'm talking about this tomorrow Heather come in didn't talk to me tomorrow please. So if you are you know you're one of these people have been trying to get into real estate for years you've paid for mentorships you've paid for seminars you've gone to things you've gotten excited you've watched YouTube videos and you've got motivated and you put things on your you know vision board and you've got goals and you got all these things but you just have never got your hands on a damn transaction it might be because you suck but it also might be because you need to start somewhere else maybe a little bit more simple right that's why Gator lending is so powerful is because you can get your hands on a transaction uh tallest as I suck no you don't you might just need to get your hands on a transaction in a different way and so one of the things I've done in the last year for my sub two students is figure out other ways that they can get their hands on transactions to learn the process overcome fears without ever having to be either the buyer the seller or the whole seller that goes out and finds the deals and so a transaction coordinator is something that we've been adding as a benefit two years ago I used to bring my transaction coordinator into all of my zooms inside of sub two and train people on transaction coordination what we've done done now over the last couple of years is turned a lot of our students into successful transaction coordinators who are now helping other people become transaction coordinators. Heather being a transaction coordinator today is the result of me working for three years to bring the value to other people that turned around and gave her that same value so that is what a transaction coordinator is it's how that's how you get benefited one of the greatest things you can ever do if you are a husband and you are struggling to get your wife in the business is to get your wife trained as a transaction coordinator I will never do teaching transaction coordination on YouTube or any free way I because it involves my contracts it involves my paperwork which is proprietary and my students sign a contract stating that they'll never share that in the open public and nor will I and so subject to seller finance, novice agreements, wraps, lease options all of those contracts my transaction coordination training is only for my sub two students so if you guys come down the pipe and go can I learn can I learn how to be a transaction coordinator sure go pay somebody 15,000 dollars to learn how to be a transaction coordinator for real estate agents or wholesalers but I will personally never teach transaction coordination for creative finance items unless you are an existing sub two student so sorry to close that door and some people that are very excited about it but that is um maji says I'm manifesting I love that okay so we have sufficiently check the box on what a transaction coordinator is we've sufficiently check the box on how Heather learned how to become a transaction coordinator and we have sufficiently check the box on how did Heather get interface with these types of opportunities so let's rehearse what those opportunities are just one more time for the people that now their brains understand what a transaction coordinator is so now they can comprehend what the hell you're talking about yeah I didn't even know what a tc was two and a half weeks I mean just like in you know back then back then but yeah so I got a thousand EMD that I'm going to be loaning for 60 days I'll make 500 on that and that was the one we were talking about last night where it's not it hasn't been it's it's already been signed with a non-gator wholesale contract so I've got to call title and see if it's in a mutual release state okay so let's let's let's stay on that for just a second okay so guys take out your no pads and your pens okay because I'm answering questions right now okay I'm answering questions there's a question right there that just because I did not lay out the question doesn't mean there wasn't a very specific upcoming very common question and here's the question pace the whole seller that I'm going to um fund my thousand dollar earnest money to the whole seller use the wrong contract what should I do did everybody understand that that's the question okay give me a yes in the comments especially for your non-subtuced and that's no I will I will if you are a non-subtuced and you know you don't know this but I will get on your ass if you do not fill up my chat there's something magical that happens when you confirm through your own fingers your fingers then plug that into your brain that you understand it and we can move forward okay thank you guys so much so that's the question the question is pace I've got a I've got a wholesaler that's got a deal and they need me to fund a thousand dollars earnest money and I'm really looking forward to this because I can make a couple thousand bucks or five hundred bucks or a thousand dollars or whatever it is however the contract that they used first thing that you you did properly is review their contract is step number one review their contract okay guess what they didn't use they didn't use the contract that we as a team we as we as a group need to educate all the wholesalers and the nation that they should be using this contract in order to get gator lending from us okay so use the wrong contract and why is that so important well we cover this in gator lending number three which is the contract that you use should give you the ability to get them earnest money back in the event that the wholesaler can't find a buyer in their first 10 days by the way I'm rehashing things that we talked about last week so the contract does not allow for Heather or that wholesaler to get their earnest money back if the if they canceled during their inspection period okay just real quick on that Heather I'm so sorry I have to educate while I'm teaching answering your question yeah this is part education part question answering what happens a lot today or what happens a lot is I will open a transaction I will buy a house with a seller okay seller gets a seller and I get a contract okay and in the state of Arizona I'm perfectly fine but in some of your guys is other knucklehead stupid states like Florida okay here's my seller and here's me or let's say here's the wholesaler WS is wholesaler that we get a contract okay this contract states and I'm going to buy this house for whatever dollar amount but the main thing that it states is it states that I need to put a thousand dollars down when I go open escrow at the title company so I go to the title company and I put that thousand dollars there the opportunity exists because this wholesaler right here does not have that thousand dollars and so Heather is going to bring that thousand dollars to the table however the contract that Heather is reviewing right here this contract does not state that Heather will get the earnest money back during a cancellation even if it's during the inspection period okay the average inspection period in in the country is probably about 10 to 15 days Arizona it's 10 days is our average inspection period other places like Florida it's 15 so my wholesaler is using Jamil's contract I realize is the different program then sub two but are those contracts also acceptable Marsha let me ask you that same question Marsha every other wholesale contract is an absolute waste of your life to spend your time on I don't care who's it is I don't care if it's Jerry Norton's I don't care if it's brand Daniels I don't care if it's Jerry if it's Jamil Damgees as a gator lender all of those contracts are worth less zero percent value to you as a gator lender have we sufficiently answered that question your somebody is going to come to me in 15 minutes and say well what about Max Maxwell's what about this other guy Matt Tariot guys all of those contracts are great for wholesalers that don't need gators and they're absolutely worthless for people who are gators have we sufficiently check that box do we now know the answer to that question cool but what if you know max max those are pretty freaking cool guy and Jamil Damgees my best friend so are the you know what let's do them a favor let's use their contracts right they're going to be using your contracts and they will be using my contracts okay or they will take certain things from my contracts and update theirs as long as they have a certain couple of provisions in there that protect you as a gator lender so step number one when you get interfaced with one of these wholesalers that says hey Heather I need a thousand dollars from my earnest money you want to do what step number one review the contract that they're using okay so review the contract that they're using the second thing I want you to do in this situation okay number one review the contract I have to write this down I know but you know it's funny as somebody will go what does are you need me guys this means review okay Arthur laughs but it's very true when I go to the general like public like open YouTube and like open Facebook live stuff I get people have no clue what any of these acronyms stand for so um review okay you review their contract okay and I'll give you a couple of AB like if this then that type of things in just a minute the second thing I want to do is I want to make sure I understand state law okay why because in Arizona nobody cares if I'm during if I have an inspection period so check this out guys here's the timeline somebody's gonna ask one day they're gonna have a hard time so S means seller WS means wholesaler right wholesaler means they're not gonna actually buy the property okay what happens is this contract has about a 10 day lifespan before it goes it goes bad okay has a what would you call that not a due date what's the thing expiration date now that's not the technical term for it but let's think of it as a jar of pickles with an expiration date okay and usually that expiration date is about 10 days so on day one all the way through Heather who is the lender wants to make sure that her earnest money is protected right so she funds the earnest money to the title company yes that's where it goes the money goes to the title company from Heather okay and that money sits in there for essentially that lifespan okay in Arizona if I cancel at any point along the way I cancel at any point even on the 10th day listen to me guys if I cancel at any point along my inspection period and the inspection period could be anything sometimes a seller wants you to have zero inspection period and we're gonna get into that in a little bit as well this is why you should review the contract does the contract have an inspection period okay you're in your your contract is going to state how long how how much life you have here does everybody understand that okay can I cut here let's do a little quit a little Q&A can a wholesalers contract or can and even our contract the gator contract can it state zero inspection days zero ability to have an inspection period can it state that cool can it also state that we have a 60 day window a 60 day expiration date amazing I can't tell you some people are going to say well how where do I you know what should I get what should I make sure that there's an expect you know an inspection day standard is 10 days okay that's standard but the wholesaler and the seller unfortunately they're the ones that work that out and negotiate that so that's not really up to you now you can train your wholesalers that you're working with and say look guys I'd really appreciate a 10 day time frame because it's going to take you some time to find a buyer because that's essentially what these wholesalers are doing right wholesalers are stupid because what they do is they go get a contract right here pay attention to this they will go get a contract with a seller well before they even have somebody to buy that contract okay and then they're the ones that are coming into wholesale hotline and they're the ones that are saying hey I have a contract but it's not selling okay so what you will run into from time to time okay what you will run into is that now what is the what once the whole seller gets a contract signed and they open escrow they get their thousand dollars earnest money funded by let's say Heather what does that wholesaler now go focus their entire time and energy on for the next 10 days Heather finding a buyer finding a buyer desperately waking up in the morning with cold sweats I need a buyer I need a buyer I need a buyer I need a buyer so let's say that they bought the house for $200,000 or that's what the contract is they're now going to go and try and find a buyer out in the world right here's the here's the here's the world that's what my world looks like they're going to try and find this little buyer down here and say hey buyer I I will sell this house to you for $220,000 and they're going to try and make a $20,000 sign-up fee or $25,000 or $27,000 sign-up fee or whatever now what they're going to do is they're going to ask this buyer somewhere in the world to do what Heather they are going to ask them to put a non-refundable EMD down that's larger than the seller yes there you go love it so Heather put in a thousand dollars because that's what the wholesaler and seller we call this the a b contract okay okay a is the seller that's the first person and then the next person in that line would be the wholesaler so the next one would be the b to see contract so we're trying we are b and they are c so I'm going to have another contract with them and this contract is going to state that this person has no inspection period and they need to bring at least $3,000 and then that way I know as Heather the person who loaned the thousand I know that no matter what happens that transaction I'm getting my $1,000 back plus I will get the other I will get $2,000 out of that $3,000 and why is that why do I not get the full $3,000 everybody people are thinking and typing there you go a lot of people got the answer $1,000 goes to the seller so here's what happens the buyer comes in and the buyer brings in $3,000 earn us money I as Heather brought in a thousand dollars so combined there's $4,000 sitting in escrow at the title company just sitting there waiting for the transaction to be closed let's say that the buyer cancels okay that this money now guess what I get the way the contracts are written is that that money is now forfeited by that buyer and what ends up happening is this out of this $4,000 $1,000 of that goes to the seller okay because the seller had their security up here if you guys remember remember there's this contract right here they have a thousand dollars of security that they wrote in the contract that stated that they get to keep $1,000 if that whole seller goes past that 10-day mark without canceling okay by the way this is a rehash of what we already talked about last week but you know repetition is the is the is the king or whatever that phrase is so the seller now gets their $1,000 so they're taking care of right now how much money is left over well guess guess what there's or a thousand I'm sorry there's $3,000 left over here okay because I had my $4,000 here and $1,000 of it went to the seller so the seller's happy and guess what I now to get to replenish my $1,000 that goes back to me and the beautiful thing is what is left over also goes to me and that is my $2,000 of profit even if the transaction does not complete however Heather's question is very important because in Arizona listen to me in Arizona we are the greatest state in the United States all of your other states suck you guys all should move to Arizona everybody else sucks okay I don't really mean that I'm just kidding but some of you guys the states are really challenging and here's why they're challenging is because the state of California the state of Utah the state of Florida the state of Texas require a mutual release of the earnest money which means even if okay even if I'm in this 10-day period right here am I is this too messy or is this okay no looks good we can do it so this 10-day inspection period that I had in this original contract it says that I can cancel for any reason you know the you know what the state of Utah the state of Florida the state of Texas the state of California does not allow is they will let me cancel the contract but what they do is they say no problem we will give you your earnest money back if and only if what the seller mutually agrees and signs off on it that is correct the seller has to physically write that they approve that you get your money back okay is everybody aware of this I know we've covered this last week but I just want to go over this again because it leads into answering the question okay so I currently have I currently have I think three transactions in Houston Texas that I have a thousand dollars of earnest money sitting there for over four stinking years one because I didn't know that there was that was even such a thing everything I had done up until four years ago was all in the state of Arizona I just recently bought started buying outside of the state of Arizona about four years ago okay so in Arizona if I cancel during my 10-day inspection period let me ask you a question in Arizona do I need the seller's permission in order to get my my earnest money back no no that's why I had an inspection period however some of your states even if I have an inspection period meaning I have 10 days to inspect the product before I actually finalized the transaction and during that inspection period I can say hey you know what I saw something I didn't like I got a bad feeling I woke up with a cold or sneeze and I decided I don't want to buy this house you can cancel for any reason if you're the buyer you can cancel for zero reasons if you are the seller the only reason you can cancel if you're the seller is what reason Heather do you know is gosh I don't actually know if I know that one there is only one way a seller can cancel a contract with you it's if you the buyer breach anything in that contract you the buyer have to cause a problem that gives the seller cause the seller can't just go and say I'm not doing this deal anymore yeah the seller is legally bound does it doesn't it doesn't matter what state you're in no state on the planet earth no state will allow a seller to cancel a contract that's good that's good Tony York says or they can prove they signed under duress I've never heard of that once ever happening I would love to see that actually happen sounds like some amber amber herds shit okay I found out that this isn't in Illinois it's in Arkansas so I need to I still need to call title love it love it love it love it so we're filling in a lot of gaps guys so that I can make sure we never have to cover this again so we can move forward in the training okay so and some of this we've already rehashed but we got to do it again because apparently people need to hear it a second or third time I'm looking at the comments and people like wow oh my gosh almost as if we've never talked about this so I'm rehashing it maybe filling in some gaps maybe that gives you guys some additional benefits so in the state of Arizona as the gator lender I don't care really what contract my wholesaler uses my wholesaler could technically use okay my wholesaler could technically use Jerry norin or Jamil dams yours Brent Daniels wholesale contract couldn't they yeah because my state allows me to get my earnest money back however what contracts do I always want to make sure I use of paces no matter what state you want to make sure that the agreement between you and the wholesaler the agreement between you and the wholesaler the JV agreement states that when you thereby are cancels that you get the earnest money right there that contract does not exist anywhere in the planet except for right here it's the only place that that's ever been created nobody's ever even created these ideas and these thoughts okay so Heather had the situation that Heather's in as she has a state she has a wholesaler that has a contract so let's go through this what's the first thing that we should do in this situation we should number one review their contract what contract did they use does it state that they can did they use the right contract if the answers know what do we then do okay if the answers know ask them to do a new contract go back to the seller and get a new contract go back and refresh that that's never going to happen yeah in this case I didn't want to hell no or be get an addendum okay an addendum also created and given to you guys again this guys this is cost me over seven thousand dollars just for this set of documents just wait for the future transactions that I will be training you guys on these addendums that addendum has already been provided to you it is in the documents okay now the other thing that you can do is see if they did not use the right contract make sure you then go to roll number two which is hey if their state law allows for you to get your EMD back Arizona's one of those states then I really don't care about that contract that they use those are the three things you do you review the contract they go I'm an I use jimils contract which actually is a good wholesale contract but it's not good for this okay Jesse case as EMD loan agreement has a significant typo perfect please let Kelli Hano know that or put it put it um go to uh yeah email Kelli Hano okay I've got a few things I noticed to all he number perfect okay so I'm going to check state law right in in Arizona I how do I check state law do I like call an attorney or maybe what I do is I call the title company who's going to be in charge of the transaction in the first place that might as well be the god of the transaction title company is title company is going to be the people who ultimately release their in his money back to you anyway and they're the ones handling the transaction for the most part they are the people you want to ask hey if I loan this thousand dollars here's the script because somebody's going to go what do I say how do I talk to another human being so what you do is you go hey um title company my name is pace morbby I'm coming in and joint venturing with the whole seller on this deal and I'm bringing a thousand dollars as earnest money but I really want to make sure that you guys do not require the seller to release my earnest money back to me if we cancel during the inspection period I have just given you the script okay that script has just been said to you I'm sure that Rachel on my team will take that script and write that into the syllabus yes guys we are creating a syllabus behind me Rachel on our team is going through and taking the notes and then building this into an entire syllabus okay um even in a state like Arizona can a contract have verbiage in which you still need to review to ensure your money is protected um yes you should always review the contract you should always look at it so guys who should I ask let's at the end of the day who's the person I should ask this question to I don't come okay because you guys are going to you guys are going to give me a barrage of questions that can all be answered by who right let's be resourceful go get yourself into a transaction and talk to who there you go closing attorney or the title company closing attorney or the title company okay closing attorney or the title company closing attorney or the title company okay um you asked the person who's in charge of the transaction okay ask the person in charge of the transaction and the hub of the transaction is always the title company okay so now the contract that you really want to make sure is there once the once you get past that point and Heather has a she has a contract right now in Arkansas where somebody needs a thousand dollars of hers to cover the earnest money right so Heather what questions you have about that I feel like we've now sufficiently answered a lot of people's questions um yeah as far as getting here yeah I don't think there's anything else on that one I just need to call title and and see what Arkansas is and then perfect let me quiz you yeah so the the title company says actually um yeah Heather we require a mutual release from the seller and um that's just the way it is so if you get even if you guys canceled during the inspection period yes the seller has to sign off on us wiring the money back to you what do you then do then I go back to the whole seller and say I can't do it unless um unless okay I missed that one or I don't remember number two this uh no they already said they won't do a new contract and they won't do it and it's end up they don't want to they don't want to you know make the seller thing because there's going to be any reason that they might cancel or something so they are said they won't do that perfect so they this is why wholesalers are dumb so when people feel all all sad about oh my pace made fun of me I'm a wholesaler and pace is making fun of me because you're an idiot you know just make sure you know make sure but that was what the that was uh we were trying to find a way to to do it if it was still protected but since it's not then yeah you don't do it isn't yeah this is a critical answer for all of you gators out there here's what's going to happen okay the whole seller unfortunately here's what's going to happen as a gator you guys are going to run into a lot of opportunities in the very beginning stages of this okay so there's some trade off here okay the tradeoff is that nobody else is getting this live training nobody else is going to be in live Q&As except for this group of people okay and the negative part of this is that you guys are going to be part of the the moving forward momentum of changing part of the industry and getting people actually utilize the proper documents and the proper contracts so that they can actually receive earnest money from you guys okay so you guys are going to come to me and go oh man these whole I keep I keep running into opportunities but these wholesalers are using your wrong contracts yeah you've been for warned warned welcome to business this isn't like sitting in your cubicle or your boss tells you what to do all day long this is you having to go and navigate the world like a human being okay you just go make some relationships with them and then be like hey I'm willing to lend you if you use this contract and just keep in touch with them and make sure they are yes so um if these if your wholesaler I don't want to go back to my seller because I didn't build strong enough rapport with them I use the wrong contract and I don't know how to talk to a seller that I in fact it was like by the grace of God that I even got this contract in the first place and it's hanging on by a thread if I go back and call the seller I'm worried that the sellers are trying to cancel cancel on me okay do not fund that earnest money and why not he'll lose your money get back you'll never get it back and you'll come back to me guys I am telling you right now if somebody ever comes back into the into the zoom and type side comes in the side chat says I lost money on the last gator thing I did whose fault is that ever put yourself in a risky situation okay never put yourself in a risky situation there are so many opportunities Heather who is probably not even trying to go out and find these gator opportunities just goes oh my gosh now that I know that these opportunities exist they just magically popped up and I jumped on them imagine what you actually go out and you start going to the places and I'll do this probably in the next training as I'll show you guys where to find these opportunities and how to be one of these people goes out and get these deals done you will run into a lot of wholesalers in the beginning that say oh my gosh I would love for you to fund my earnest money however I don't have the right contract and the answer I would tell you is say no um have a deal let me see if I can pull it up I have a deal right now where somebody came to me and wanted $26,000 okay and they were going to pay me $6,000 for basically two days I was like all right $26,000 now $26,000 in here for a lot of people that are just starting out I know Heather um I would say that $26,000 would probably pinch you to a point like I don't want to do that deal in the first place that's a lot of money to put out there right that's the other part of this gator training that I'm going to be doing with you guys long term is that I want you guys to build up corporate credit so that when you see a $26,000 dollar opportunity it's not scary for you do you guys understand now partly why I had you guys go through the prime corporate services corporate credit building thing okay you can actually take advantage of those yeah I got 20k going out for one but it's saving so it hurts so I don't want you doing that I want you got I mean do it in the beginning get some bankroll going but at some point you guys will build your corporate credit we're going to bring prime corporate services in here to talk about that kind of stuff and I can't here's the thing I've tried to have prime corporate services no offense to them but I've tried to have prime corporate services come into my sub two community and teach corporate credit for free because they teach all sorts of other crazy cool things for free and they're like dude we do not think that that's okay that's like giving our secret sauce away and it's like okay so that's why I now can get them in here because you guys are actually all prime corporate credit clients and now we can actually bring them in here and as a community build corporate credit and I can show you guys what I do et cetera it's going to be amazing okay the owner is going to come in here the corporate credit team's going to come in here so this deal that came across my table at $26,000 first and foremost I do got to show you this it's really good the whole seller says hey can I pay you $2,000 for this loan what do you think I said okay so I've got this deal let me pull it up real quick little screenshot of a text thread between me and somebody else that wanted $26,000 and I want to show you guys kind of how I negotiated with them back and forth so you guys can kind of see that just to see how much power you have when you actually are the one with the money you will feel like the almighty what that help if you guys saw how I negotiated with them yeah okay hold on a sec see it was probably give me a second guys I know I'm usually flapping my job but I want to make sure I show this to you guys okay so essentially he came to me is like hey I need $26,000 and I'm like okay great well let's do a deal where you two thousand dollars is not enough money for me so why don't we work out something that's more beneficial he's like well what are you thinking and I said and usually I loan two thousand and I get two thousand dollars back he's like okay so I'll do three thousand I was like how about six and he said how about five and I said how about six okay okay here we go so this kind of stuff happens all the time and oh how's that there we go sorry guys just want to make sure I can give you a visual I'm a visual learner so I'd like to see this stuff instead of people just telling me stories it's just easier for me to actually see things in person myself so I'm sure you guys feel similar to that all right so I you know of course I save people in my phone as wholesaler that's if you are a wholesaler that's how I put you in there he says he says can you call me you know I was like no I'm in a phone I'm in a car with somebody else like three other people are all on the phone call so that's why he's saying okay LMAO I said what will you pay me he says I'll give you 23 again no not worth it okay so let me teach you guys something about negotiating it's the same reason why I'm one of the greatest real estate closures is because I don't name my price okay do I name my price anywhere for the first couple of text messages back and forth so what will you pay me no not worth it and then I stop he goes how much do you need it for him it to make sense I go so I instead of giving him the answer I give him an answer that is not his answer does this make sense so I say I lend people 2k and get my money back plus 2k if you want 21 thousand I need a lot more sorry I thought it was 26 grand it's actually 21 grand I'm sorry you guys okay look I'll give you five on top of it and so I said not enough not really I go not really he was that's a lot I was like not really give me six okay and the thread kept going on he kept he kept he said okay and then he came back and he was like how about five I was like how about six I just kept staying on six okay so I just taught you somebody's gonna say how do I negotiate with these people I just told you not plan what's how much how much is it worth it to you how do I think that you getting paid five hundred dollars for a thousand dollar earners money you under under under charged did I dramatically okay dramatically what would you for that thousand what's what minimum a thousand dollars okay minimum a thousand dollars yeah they they named their price it was like 300 to 500 so of course I picked 500 so I need to let me teach you let me teach you something other yeah so let's go through that so they go so you go name how did that go did they say all name your price or did you say how much would you pay me what'd you say no they just said hey we've got a thousand dollar EMD we need you know and I said what's what's typical I guess I said you know what's the tip since I'm learning what's the typical yeah okay okay so here's what I would have said if they said if somebody said three to five that three to five hundred I'd say oh man I have somebody else I'm lending so third party stories I've taught you this and create a fight in the sub two mentorship a lot right fictitious third parties are one of the greatest negotiating tactics of all time so you go oh man I have a thousand dollars going out next week to somebody else and they're paying me two thousand dollar return is five hundred dollars the most you can pay so good okay so with with you Heather so with your deal I would say you should have used a third a third party for a couple of reasons one because it works and two because you should be manifesting that anyway and by saying by hey next week I'm going to somebody needs me to fund their son is it true that next week somebody needs Heather to fund a transaction for them yeah cuz I'm gonna go find it and even and even if you don't find them do they still exist yeah somebody's out there going damn it I wish I knew somebody to would fund my earnest mate that is not a lie so you can say I have somebody that needs me to fund them next week that I am charging two thousand dollars to yeah I love that yeah I didn't I thought fifty fifty percent was like great okay this is awesome but knowing that yeah you can get get a little bit more if that's that's that's even better I'm this is this is why we call a gator train gator lending I want chunks okay I'm not looking at this as a return of a percentage or anything like that I'm trying to say what is the chunk yeah I have risked myself I have gone out and I have bought corporate credit I have listened to pace Sunday morning on Mother's Day on a Zoom which is unlike pace I have put myself out there and now I'm giving you a thousand dollars of my money and I'm risking my neck I'm not doing that for five hundred bucks okay make sense yeah minimum minimum I would charge okay now you guys know your business better than I it doesn't mean listen to me cuz there are people in and out there in the world that list that live in the black in the white the black in the white is pace said don't do it for under five hundred for under thousand dollars yeah I'm not going to do it and then pass up opportunities if that's your only opportunity and you can make five hundred dollars and the paperwork's right and everything's good then do it because it might be good for you to go through the process but don't do it because you think five hundred dollars is a good return yeah and you can always like negotiate it and try try try again and if they're just gonna walk away then you know if you need it then go for it yeah so for me I would look at that and I go this is great for me to go through the process and make five hundred dollars in in return as long as everything is good but as you get more and more advanced I can tell you as a community listen to me you guys know about the listen to me this might be the most important thing I will say all day long you guys ready for something incredibly important listen to me right now do you know about the conspiracy theory about the light bulb and how they raised the prices of all the light bulbs one of the greatest stories of all time a collective group of light bulb manufacturers got together and they said how do we conspire to set the price as a collective group on light bulbs so that none of us undercut each other and we all make a lot of money otherwise we're just gonna fight each other to the bottom they got together and oh my freaking gosh here's what they did they figured out how to actually make their light bulbs last last time over the at the very beginning when the light bulb was invented the light bulb would let's say last a thousand hours by the time it creates inventions and all this kind of stuff happened now they they lasted a hundred hours but why did every manufacturer also go down to a hundred hours of lifetime it's because they conspired together to make sure that they set the quality and the price of their product so that they all could keep their margins intact I am telling you that as a group there is nobody out there teaching this there's no guru out there that even knows this it really even exists they don't even know that this is a thing I was on somebody else's live this morning and they were like do tell me about what Gator lending is and he's he's been in the business 17 years and he goes holy shit the way your brain works how did this even happen I go dude I'm only telling you about the earnest money side you ready for a two more hour dissertation about all the other cool things that we're going to be doing do not undercut each other do not be one of those people that goes out there and goes well I'll do for seven hundred dollars if they'll do it for eight hundred dude do not be that guy okay what I would set the tone of guys is do we kind of think that maybe I put in a thousand dollars earnest money I think a thousand dollar return is kind of like where my baseline should be you guys all kind of agree with that okay I that's my minimum for me I won't I wouldn't do it I'd rather see one of you guys do the loan out of a thousand dollars and I wouldn't consider yourself undercutting but for me my my goal is a thousand dollars out two thousand return back which means I get three thousand dollars back that's what my mine is okay one thing I just want to point out real quick so Tyler Snyder says absolutely a thousand dollars doesn't even cover my PCS charges yet however let me tell you something that does cover your PCS charges the millions of dollars of game that I have given you since you you signed up millions of dollars of game you have no idea you could just be a gator lender the rest of your life build an entire business off of just this one thing and make more money than doctors lawyers architects surgeons etc and you did it and you got it from me or free I've started doing projections on what what's possible especially with and I'm like what so it one one thing I'm going to tell you guys about mindset guys I paid 30 thousand dollars to be in a mine mentorship a mastermind in January already since January one relationship in that mastermind that I that I joined I made one point five million dollars you know it's funny as I never thought about oh I got to hurry up and go cover the cost of my thirty thousand dollars never have I thought like I got to cover my cost of my thirty thousand dollars guys that's a small mindset okay it's a small mindset now what's funny is I look at that one point five million dollars it's not one point five million dollars to me for me it's like I can compound this compound compound compound compound compound that one thirty thousand dollar thing brought me I don't know a hundred million dollars over my lifetime in potential profits because of the things I learned and the people I met okay I'm not getting on you for that but let's just remind ourselves that the price you paid to to PCS is a grain of sand compared to how much money you will make and also the mindset shifts that you have already had do you realize that this information is not anywhere you cannot google this you cannot go read this in the book you know how they say everything's available online they lie into you it ain't there pace created it and you are in here got it and this this zoom is not going on YouTube all the other stuff went out on YouTube it's closed out do you think that that's worth the price you paid to PCS even if you don't get a gator loan for the next two weeks three weeks four months five months etc got it consider yourself lucky okay cool so with you Heather on this deal I would the challenge is like that twenty one thousand dollar deal the second I found out he actually didn't even have an inspection period deep this whole seller went and bought a house from a seller with no inspection period whatsoever and I found out he was in the state of California that even if he did have an inspection period I would have had to go get an adendum so I was just like hey man I'd love to do your I ended up getting on a phone call with him I said hey this is what I need you to do and I took the drop box link for the wholesale contract ago start using this wholesale contract so that we can actually do business together and by the way never put yourself in a situation where you don't have an inspection period and I coached him okay do you guys believe that as gators people who have the opportunity make a lot of money do you feel that you're gonna have a lot of moments where you're gonna be teaching a lot of knuckleheads and you're gonna feel what one percent of my life feels like hey you have to be okay with that and have the patience right you have to have the patience of like an eternal mother where you're just like I'm okay with teaching you the same thing a thousand times and that's how you make money okay do you think tidal companies have to reeducate wholesalers on things do you think lawyers and other people that are doing business with wholesalers have to teach them on things all the time you feel like everybody in business is always constantly providing customer service to some degree you cannot make money without providing an amazing user experience so Heather your job is not to say wow you're a knucklehead I can say you guys are knuckleheads in here because you're not my customers and because I'm having fun and hopefully so are you and you know I'm not serious but if you make a wholesaler feel unwelcome um not deserving of your time you will not get them to come back and so a lot of this is building listen to this is another very important thing do not undercut each other is a very important one this is another one do not forget that these are your customers and that it's your job to entice them to come back to you for a lot of you guys that have nine to five jobs or you work in a cubicle and your boss tells you what to do all day long you don't know the value of a customer yet and you don't know how hard it is to get one and you also don't understand that sometimes a customer is somebody that you talk to 15 times before you ever make money together and you have to understand that as part of the equation it's not gosh this person keeps wasting my time it's man I'm so grateful this person's calling me instead instead of somebody else that's the mindset shift does that make sense guys definitely cool um Kevin says can we use the same contracts to consolidate gator lenders to loan out large EMDs say for commercial properties if we choose to do so yes that's called gator wrestling we've talked about that in previous training we will do that in other trainings as well okay um the the toes you step on today maybe the attach to the ass you have to kiss tomorrow that's so good can damn son that's good let's let's read that for everybody else in the back one more time I've actually I feel like I've heard that before because it's so good but I don't think I have heard that before Ken says the toes you step on today maybe the attach to the ass you have to kiss tomorrow that is so bro gosh damn it that's good Ken good job Ken I'm literally writing that down I'm gonna write down two words toes and ass that's it that's what you're in two pace yeah mostly really good that's really really good thank you for that that sums that up very quickly so obviously I know Heather she's a sweetheart and I appreciate her tremendously and I think that if I was somebody that was going to Heather and I didn't have the right contracts I would imagine that Heather would communicate with me in a way that she naturally is which is loving and daring etc and she would say I'd love to do business with you here's the contract that my mentor and I have written for you and please use this in the future so that we can do business together okay okay so Madison Gammons has a question real quick how there do you have anything else just that what the other proper or the other portfolio that I'm doing which is the I've got I gave a wrestled 80k and I'm putting in 20k for a down payment are we okay what are you getting for it in return for this I'm getting 5k the others getting 5k okay I think that that's a small return but it depends I guess on so like for example I just did a hundred thousand dollars on a deal the other day where I brought somebody else's money to the table and I got 30% ownership of a four hundred thousand dollar property okay I got a hundred and twenty thousand dollars of real estate holdings in my name so you got five grand which is pretty impressive right you got five grand or twenty thousand dollar debt right and how long are they holding that 60 days yeah I know it's a little longer but it's you're being you're being very nice whoever's getting that loan from you that's very very kind of you to put that money in most hard money lenders would not touch that deal so think about this guys as gators what are we trying to do what kind of loans are we trying to do are we trying to be hard money lenders shorter term bigger chops bigger chops of returns but what what we want is we want to kind of navigate in the space that hard money lenders really don't navigate in okay and what would that mean that would mean second lean positions for short durations typically earnest money is way too small for hard money lender like could you imagine a hard calling a hard money lender who lends out ten fifteen million dollars a month and go hey I need a thousand dollars to cover my earnest money the answer is going to be no so that's an opportunity for you as a gator as a hundred thousand dollar loan for 60 days you're treading on the hard money territory I don't think many hard money lenders are willing to do that so I still feel like you have a really competitive advantage I personally would have been trying to I probably would have tried to charge 20 grand not 10 but 10 still a good return because the reality is twenty thousand dollars five thousand dollar return is a twenty five twenty five percent return in 60 days which means multiply that by six you would get an annual return of a hundred and thirty percent so that's pretty damn good your your return is a hundred and thirty percent I personally believe that not many people would be willing to have given them that loan for ten thousand dollars and so I think you could have pushed probably closer to fifteen or twenty thousand dollars I think how they're your biggest lesson is you're going to have to learn to be a little bit more aggressive no that's I mean that's very info because yeah I've had no idea so I was just kind of going with whatever and I came my way but now yeah I can yeah and remember why is this why do you can why do you have the ability to be aggressive is because the only people that have these opportunities out there are people to understand the gator lending so hard money lenders are going to look at that deal and go first it's probably in second lean position uh yes I believe so hey so hard money lenders not going to touch that at all no matter what the dollar amount is hard money lenders don't lend in second position they just don't so who's going to come in and save them and your gator wrestling which is the third tier of what I'm going to be teaching right now we're in tier number one tier number three we're going to be talking about how to wrestle other gators which is what you did you said I'm going to bring 80 thousand dollars of somebody else's money to the table through a jv agreement and I'm going to bring 20 thousand dollars of my money hopefully in the future that's from a prime corporate set uh services um corporate credit line and I'm going to make a five thousand dollar return and the other person's in me five thousand dollar return the person who brought 80 thousand dollars to the table and got a five thousand dollar return actually actually made a phenomenal return on that money because annualize that's probably a 40 percent return annualize that's very good that's four times more than a hard money lender would have charged so it's good but you could have charged more money and that's all I'm saying okay no that's good to know and do I use the same contract like the wholesale new gator pull back to all the same okay yep uh mike mcdermott says um branded mix pace can you touch touch on usury laws usury laws brother i'll touch on this for one time and one time only are you guys ready for me to touch on usury laws you guys ready everybody ready you guys all are aware i'm going to touch on usury laws just real quick okay i'm going to answer it one time if it comes up again i will take a chomp out of you that usury laws are based on interest are we charging interest no we're not guess what we're doing we are doing a joint venture where we are bringing a resource to the table and gaining a portion of the profits of the deal does that sound like a usery violation no usery violations have to do with percentage you are charging on an agreement for alone you are doing a joint venture this is why we have a joint venture agreement you are not doing a loan you are joint venturing on the deal there is a jv agreement that you're having these people sign what you bring to the what you bring to the table is a resource is your contribution to the deal is a resource and you then get to participate as a joint venture partner on the deal does that make sense have we sufficiently handled that these are things i have gotten my personal attorney involved so you don't have to what was that called a user usery laws is basically charging people too much interest i got it okay so you get people like those check caching places or you know title loan places or whatever that can charge upwards of like 25% return on their loans okay we're not charging percentages have have you guys ever heard me to say i'm charging any percentage okay so i'm answering this one again too this needs to go in this needs to go into the to the pamphlet or not the pamphlet but the training is that we're not charging percentages that's for hard money lenders and that's for private money lenders okay we are taking chunks based on a joint venture agreement we are taking a portion of the joint venture profits based on our partnership with the person we are doing the deal with that makes sense let me ask you a question if i am a business partner with my business partner Cody and i make 50 oh here's a good one let's say a wholesaler has a house under contract and they're going to assign it to a buyer but they can't find a buyer so i come to the table and i bring a buyer and we split the profits 50-50 i literally made 10 grand with no money out of my pocket because i brought a resource to the table just because i brought i made half of the profits is that mean that i i violated usery laws no we are in a joint venture agreement whatever the resources that i brought to the table justifies my ownership in that transaction i am not your lender i am actually your joint venture partner utilizing my contracts have we clarified your relationship in this zoom yet that alone is where the hundred thousand dollars a game right there somebody in a week will go but i still haven't covered my pcs costs and this is why you're broke because that's how you think what i just taught you took me 10 years to learn and to figure out how to articulate and then educate it to other people nobody told me that i had to come up with that on my own you're welcome there you go peace of game worth a hundred thousand dollars okay a couple of really good questions um really good questions so give me just a second so Heather let me wrap you up i'm very sorry um you so you have that deal yes use the same paperwork joint venture agreement make sure that in that transaction you've got to have a note and a deed of trust right because you guys are technically lending money against the transaction what are they doing again on that property they are doing what is it it's it's a down payment for a portfolio of properties in Tennessee okay so here's where you medically undercharged you've given them the down payment and they're going to refinance you out at some point after 60 days i think that's what it is yeah if i were if that was me in that situation and again as a collective community guys this is what we should be doing do not under under charge yourself i would have wedged myself into partial ownership on top of that five thousand dollars okay i would have said give me seven percent of the portfolio or five percent or three percent of the portfolio plus my ten thousand dollar return and what if they're a whole sit like if they're just full sailing it because i don't know actually for sure well then you shouldn't wouldn't it make sense for you Heather to know what their exit strategy is if you're lending a hundred thousand dollars on it yeah for sure okay let's let's add this to the third rule okay everybody third rule of the day yeah when you're looking at transaction is what third rule of the day ask their exit strategy there you go know the exit strategy okay exit strategy i want to know what are you doing with this okay and why is that so important well one i just answered why because Heather obviously has a transaction she's involved in that it would be very beneficial for her ability to negotiate if she understood the back end of that transaction the second thing is that when you are in the middle of a deal and somebody's like hey i have it or i need the earnest money or i need transactional lending or i need this or the other if you understand the back end of that transaction and what their exit strategy is don't you think that there's an additional value stack that you can bring to the table potentially bringing a buyer or somebody else to the table and so Heather what you've done is you've cut yourself off at the past because you didn't know the exit strategy and you don't know exactly where you could insert yourself into that deal yeah i love that so if they're taking if they're keeping it you know you try to get partial ownership as well as a fee and then if they're wholesaling it you could bring a buyer yep okay i've got a trend i've got a deal right now okay where um whole sather comes to us here local in Arizona they need twenty five hundred dollars in earnest money i'm charging them twenty five hundred dollars so double that money right and then on top of that guess what they don't have they don't have a buyer so who's the buyer could be somebody in your network could be you it's me i'm the buyer so what what i what i did is i said hey if i bring the buyer to the table can i get a portion of your assignment fee so i essentially cut down my own assignment fee in half and i got paid twenty five hundred dollars for the earnest money and i ended up being the buyer on a fixing flip you're such an evil genius i am an evil genius that's that's amazing so if you don't understand the exit strategy or missing what the value is here and somebody in five minutes will go well i haven't gotten my thousand dollars from pcs yet and then somebody will follow up and say it's not a thousand dollars pace it's nineteen hundred and fifty dollars oh my gosh i just gave you a million dollar nugget a million dollar nugget insane insane what you can do yeah this is crazy crazy stuff no i appreciate that that's that's that's huge i definitely wasn't even thinking about checking the contract or asking an exit strategy but that yeah that opens up a lot of extra doors okay so a couple things guys let's see here brand and mix says will you be covering how to protect ourselves when we loan earnest money for the end buyer not the whole seller usually buyers earnest is hard from day one or are these a no go when it comes to lending that's an interesting question and let's chat about that so i think that's a great point how you doing Brandon hey pace what up that's a great that's a really great question let's let's let's um work this out for a moment so what you're what he's talking about guys for anybody um paying attention essentially what we've been talking about up until this point is the loan or the earnest money for the whole seller now what i do is i wedge myself into transactions all the time so i'm in a i'm in a transaction right now um Brandon are you aware of what the morbid method is no okay so the morbid method is a creative finance strategy that i will not be teaching you guys unfortunately but the creative finance strategy is essentially this let's say that i have a seller that wants to sell a property for three hundred thousand dollars in the air of the of that property is three hundred thousand dollars does that sound like a good deal for anybody hmm no because real estate investors want to buy below what the properties were so they can renovate it fix it up put it on the market make make a profit if it's a fixing flip and they also want to get the house as low as possible so they have the lowest amount of cost getting to that deal as they possibly can however in the morbid method what i can do is i can go pay full retail for a house and have zero dollars out of pocket in the process of purchasing it the process of the morbid method is that i go to the seller and i go hey i can give you that three hundred thousand dollars in fact i can i can pay you what you're asking but i need you to seller carry back 25% of the equity of that deal and i'll give you 75% down okay this is where people their brains go wait hold on what so where you said i was going to be in the deal with no money out of pocket okay so there's companies out there like my investor loan.com company that we use that will give me a loan for 75% of the purchase price of that property and then the seller will seller carry back the remaining 25% that i need in terms of equity in order to obtain that loan i essentially just bought that property with no money out of my pocket lender brought a non-recourse loan brand and do you know what a brand a non-recourse loan is yes i do okay so the lender brings a non-recourse loan to the table i had to maybe get sponsored because maybe i'm a newbie and my investor loans like yeah we don't really want to lend money to newbies i as the gator lender i could have sponsored that loan okay that's one set of value i i bring to the table i did 12 of these last month or all i did was sponsor other people's loans with my credentials my credit my experience and i didn't have to find the deal i don't have to manage the deal i don't have to bring the gap funding to the table i don't have to bring the construction money to the table but i own 30% of the transaction that's pretty cool that's on level for the fourth tier of what i'm going to be teaching you guys over the next couple of months okay however you still have like maybe some transactional costs like closing costs and things of that nature and if you're going to do a deal with a buyer in any transaction and you're going to be putting money up front typically the buyer shouldn't need any small transactional funding of three thousand or five thousand dollars i don't really see that being a need except for in one transaction which would be the morbid method and that would be paying for the closing cost and maybe for a little bit of like cleaning and getting the property ready for rental in that situation that money is not coming back to you right there's no place where that money is going to come back to you in a quick fashion in the wholesaler scenario the wholesaler has that money out there temporarily which gives you an amazing opportunity and then the buyer comes in with their funds which pays that back if you're lending small increments of money to the buyer you have to plan on having that money tied up in that property for a longer portion of time and if i was going to be bringing that money to the table i would not be just asking for a return on my money i would be asking for a portion of the ownership of that property yeah i got involved in uh that's why i asked the question because i almost lost my earnest money uh so it was a wholesaler that basically had a lot of properties tied up in escrow and so he ran out of earnest so you're you're you're describing a scenario that's going everybody else is going to run into so many times where they're going to be overextended right where um they don't have enough money to cover all of the earnest monies that on all the properties that they have outstanding they might be able to cover a handful of them but they can't cover all of them so what ultimately happened on that so basically uh we had a jv agreement where we were loaning the earnest money and then covering the gap financing so there was a 10% gap from the 90% hard money and we our return was going to be $3,000 so 30% essentially for how long they were saying about 60 days i was planning on more like 90 plus days uh it was a quick cosmetic flip so what ended up happening we wired i called escrow just to confirm that this was not you know a uh a fraud type account so we wired the the funds and and all of a sudden uh the wholesaler just kind of disappeared and it turned out there was so there was a wholesaler i was speaking with and then there was the partner who signed the jv agreement right i never had the contact info of that partner so-called partner and we're driving out to Vegas for the clever summit and i i decide i'm gonna contact the title company and find out what's going on with the clothes and she says oh well it's scheduled to close today well i haven't heard anything about you know wiring the balance of you know the closing costs and the the gap uh funding so i started kind of freaking out i i ended up trying to skip trace this woman and her business which uh i made a bunch of cold calls on the road and was never able to track her down what ultimately happened is um the wholesaler that actually had the contract he contacted me and i guess he got my info from title uh and it's funny because he's like what is this gator lending well i've never heard of anything like that and i guess it's because the money that i lent to this wholesaler understands the gator lending because that's where i found this i found it in your group and i decided to take action and reach out to them and so he says you know unfortunately this wholesaler has skipped out on two of my transactions never closed on them and i hate to tell you you're going to be losing your earnest money because that earnest money is hard and it goes to me so i i had to quickly think of how can we work together on this and so i basically because i i've been in real estate a number of years i understood that i was in a bad position so i said look how can we work together you need a buyer your buyer skipped out so you need a buyer how about i go find a buyer for you smart and so he's like okay i said i can't tell you how many people in here that would have put in put in that situation they would have just thrown up their hands and been like effort i lost ten thousand dollars meanwhile you are that the guys i don't even want to give him accolades even though he completely deserves them i don't want to give him accolades because that's a requirement in this business right it's kind of like that old joke of like uh i can't remember i think it was like cat Williams or maybe it was um Kevin Hart is like what do you want a purple cookie what do you want a jelly bean for doing your job this is your job now Brandon did a phenomenal job and he's been experiencing and he knew what to do he pivoted i'm sure he had a guttained stomach for a moment but he immediately you know it's game seven baby 10 seconds on the clock let's freaking make that shot and he he pivots and he says how do i get myself out of the situation guys welcome to being a business professional this is what happens can you agree with me Brandon this has happened not this exact scenario but these types of things happen hundreds of times as a business owner absolutely you always got to be on your toes and you have to think about if if scenario a does not work out what's my what's my backup plan right so i ended up finding a buyer so i i ended up getting out there and i blasted all the facebook groups you know i just i just went to town and i had probably i don't know 15 plus 15 20 buyer i had basically on friday of last week and it had to close within a week and fortunately title was clear and all it was ready to close i had probably about five or six buyers that wanted to see the property on monday but unfortunately but fortunately the wholesaler locked up a buyer on saturday prior to us the you know prior to these buyers seeing the property on monday so what ended up happening is he locked it up with a wholesaler i was a little bum because i was going to make an assignment fee but at the end of the day i said hey you know what if this is a real buyer and they're going to close on wednesday all i want is my my money back so i'm going to be ended up getting a check overnighted to us we got our original investment back so now hopefully this happens is that we still have a jv agreement that we're going to get a three thousand dollar fee because we loan that money to that wholesaler they're thinking that they that we lost our money and so she's like i need to get you your money back i'm not looking at it that they're reimbursing our original three thousand i'm looking at it that you are paying us the fee that you originally told and all the work that i had to put into this so we're probably a couple of weeks out from that we'll see how it ends up i might end up still making a few thousand bucks on it but we'll see okay so let's go let's go through this for a couple of minutes because this is super important especially when we're now in the training so many people could not wait for me to actually get to the point where we have the paperwork they'd nobody wants to wait right action takers take action which i respect and i completely understand people doing hundreds of dm's over the last month or so of like hey i'm in the middle of the transaction what do i do my guys please wait for me like what you know what most people do they would have taken a year of their life to go create a training program and sold it to you for ten thousand dollars that's what they would have done instead i decided to do something differently and i decided hey let's do this is live and we'll go through chronologically and unfortunately you guys will have to have the patience of a thousand great gods like you have to have patience to get through this and unfortunately Brandon you didn't have the greatest patience you ran headfirst into transactions i'm telling you guys right now write this down do not get into transactions if you do not know what you're doing just don't the opportunities will be there whether it's now three months from now six months from now this opportunity is not going away it's only going to get bigger and bigger and bigger with more wholesale regulations where more people are going to have to double close and just um discreetly be wholesalers because wholesaling is going to be a shameful practice in about five years okay because the n-a-r like in state of Arizona is now telling legally wholesalers have to tell their sellers that they are a wholesaler and they intend to wholesale it or that contract is not valid your contract is not valid if it does not state that you are a wholesaler and you intend to wholesale that property and you have to also verbally tell the seller that that's what your intention is what happens there guys is now every wholesaler on the planet wants to double close does that not see you guys not see the opportunities for you especially as you gain more and more capital so the challenge is a couple of things i see that you didn't review the underlying contract right you didn't see that they had it they had a contract with a wholesaler that set stated that it's non-refundable earnus money this is why number one review the contract that they are currently buying okay i like i like the loan it's smart um ten thousand dollars they they it's out there for a little bit you get three or four thousand dollars you get a 30 percent return in a 60 day period which actually is um 120 percent or so 120 percent return that's pretty good okay and you were smart enough to go out there and go i'll go find the buyer and you have to give credit to that um wholesaler who communicated with you and they were obviously a professional but guess what you also did is you built a relationship with wholesaler now you can go hey anytime you have an opportunity send it over to me i can help you dispo it right well and also sorry so on the paperwork side guys if you don't understand the paperwork a hundred percent do not do these transactions okay be patient the opportunity is humongous a doctor makes two hundred fifty to five hundred thousand dollars a year and it takes them sixteen years to be able to make that kind of money as a gator it will take you about sixteen weeks so please be patient through the process and learn that you need to protect yourself brand-in is somebody who's been in real estate for a long time and he understands how to pivot and do all that kind of stuff there's a lot of people in here that don't know how to do that and your paperwork will keep you from having to pivot okay um Jonathan as Bell is there any stipulation in your contracts that detail what happens in in the reasonable absence of a participant yeah you are a jv on the deal so let's say that there's a there is no word from the wholesaler and the the inspection period is coming due guess what you do you call title and go i can't i haven't heard from my partner cancel the contracts and my earnest money back you have the ability to communicate with a title company because of the jv agreement that you signed so with brand-in what you didn't do is you didn't review his underlying contract otherwise you would have learned that you probably should not have put that money up in the first place yeah yeah right the other the other thing that you know i i feel good about and you're talking about building a relationship with this other wholesaler is he's out about seven hundred and fifty dollars because he had a mobile notary sent to the seller's house for the first closing the one with the wholesaler that skipped out so he's out the mobile notary for the signed uh docs on that and then he sent the mobile notary again with the new buyer because the new closing docs have to be a resigned so he's out seven hundred fifty but he was going to take it out of my three thousand i said absolutely not so i said i'll tell you what uh i'm going to try to get my money back or try to get my fee as soon as that comes in i promise you i'm a man of my word and i was i was raised with ethics and morals i will as long as you can confirm that i will go ahead and reimburse you for that seven hundred fifty bucks because you did not take my three thousand dollars so yeah you know and that's that's something that i've learned in real estate is you you got to be a man of your wording you got to stick through with that and hundred percent yeah yeah um so good question yeah Brandon it works it works even for the buyer especially so your buyer was essentially doing what we call a whole tail flip they were basically buying it quickly putting it cleaning it up putting it on the market they're going to sell it you were right in assuming it wasn't going to be 60 days it was going to be 90 days because you've been in a business you know how that that happens that their end buyers are going to take some time and um ultimately take more than 60 days still a 90 day return on 30% of your money that's pretty dang good still 120% return on your money annualized right so really good deal so yes you can do it for end buyers but again for everybody else listening Brandon knows this we are not hard money lenders okay we are not out there being private money lenders trying to partner with people long term i have part private money lenders guys okay listen to this private money lenders are not out there trying to make a living on lending listen to this private money lenders are not trying to make a living on lending money are we private money lenders we are not okay there is a difference there's basically three things here there's a hard money lender that they do that for a living you can google any state right now any city right now type in phoenix Arizona hard money lenders and they call themselves hard money lenders there's thousands of them in my market thousands of them in every single market probably in LA and bigger cities like Dallas and Houston there's probably tens of thousands of hard money lenders okay they do it for a living they want to be in first position and they want to charge anywhere between eight percent upwards of 18 percent depending on that lender okay they do it as a business okay if massive amounts of money they're not looking for chunks they're looking for a reasonable return on lending money in first position you don't know what first and second position is go watch YouTube and figure what that out what that is okay i've already talked about that in previous skater trainings then the second thing we're talking about is private money lenders private money lenders are typically people that have a couple million bucks maybe a couple hundred thousand dollars and they're like i don't want my money that sitting there doing nothing so i'll lend that money out to people for longer term situations and they're not looking for chunks okay because you guys deserve chunks and i'll tell you why you deserve chunks you deserve chunks because this is an active business that you're doing this as a living it requires reviewing reviewing paperwork calling title companies making sure that you are covered and protected across multiple bases because there's more more moving parts there is more at stake in these loans therefore there should be a larger return a private money lender goes yeah here's my money when you're done with whatever you're doing pay it back to me with my additional interest what private money lenders are trying to do is they're trying to um mitigate their risk against inflation they're trying to have some return some passive income private money lending is truly the only passive money that there really is you use my money bring it back to me i didn't have to do anything except send you a wire transfer okay are we private money lenders no no if i Jonathan as Bell says i think you should change the name from gator lending to gator jv if i did that do you think any of you guys would even be here i could Jonathan i'm gonna take you i'm gonna give you some advice go to a marketing course and then do another one and then another one and then do like 18 more and by the time you're through 25 marketing courses you might know five percent of what i know on marketing i named it gator lending because i know what i'm doing okay um so Brandon really smart bro um i love the example i appreciate you bringing that up i think you know by the way guys you think it's nice to have a brand and in this group that brand and can kind of help lend some expertise on some of these types of transactions okay he might be somebody you want to squat up with he's obviously not a student of sub two or else he would know what morbid method was um so but doesn't mean he doesn't have a tremendous amount of experience in the wholesale cash world so um Brandon i like that loan i would have done that loan for sure i think again just talking to everybody else out there i would have made sure my contract was reviewed and um i had the ability to get my earnest money back the second thing i would have done is i would have said um you know what your guys is exit strategy i would have known all the principle all the parties involved and then the third thing is i would have made sure that i had the ability to cancel the contract if somebody ghosted me through my jv agreement your jv agreement should bring you in as a principle to the deal so that the title company feels comfortable answering a phone call from Brandon so you can go hey title company i haven't heard from these knuckleheads cancel my my contract or cancel the contract notify the seller whoever it is and send me my ten thousand dollars back there's a couple things that the paper would work would have solved for you perfect thanks but freaking great job man i love that really really good stuff so yeah you guys can lend on both wholesalers and um the buyer in that situation the wholesaler at that they're actually just doing a quick fix and flip i'm surprised that they just completely ghosted the situation it's just so funny how this business works you know what i'm saying um okay all right guys i've got um i've got ten minutes and then i'm gonna go enjoy my day with my wife yasser what's up brother how you doing hey what's up brother how you doing man good to see you man yeah no good see too well thank you for this man i you you answered pretty much most of the questions i had uh love it it's such face with you and um the the question i had uh i think it was an answer it was more of a suggestion is um like reviewing the the the assignment contract so once let's say the wholesale it finds the buyer uh you know you would essentially go in and review the contract as well because you don't know what they're uh collecting for earnest money from from the buyer the unbiased correct you should because you're a jv on the deal right and so when you're when their end buyer comes in and deposits the earnest money the title company should be notifying everybody that the end buyer came in and here's the receipt of their their earnest money so yes you should be reviewing that and you should see a receipt that is a larger dollar amount so listen to this is a great question yasser is bringing up if i pro if i put like i'm Heather Whitsick in her situation i put a thousand dollars up of earnest money what i want to see is i want to see that my wholesaler who i put their earnest money up for is actually bringing their end buyer with an earnest money at least three thousand dollars and i get an actual receipt that the title company has received that money in their account does that make sense guys you need that receipt and if you do not get that receipt even if the title company tells you they received it even if the wholesaler says oh i got it the title company cancel the contract if you have time in your inspection period if you do not have a receipt from the earnest money does that make sense yeah yeah uh another thing that you brought up to that and this is i'm literally dealing with this in the morning the two hours spent on the phone with the wholesaler essentially educating the wholesaler you know about like how to how to do it correctly you know how to work a deal correctly it's his first wholesale deal five thousand check these numbers uh Heather i'm trying to connect with you too on this but um five thousand earnest money is being funded and we're asking for four grand back so essentially i'm getting nine grand back one is the deal thanks you know essentially funding the buyer too so i think i'm going to renegotiate now what would you do if you know the wholesaler can't find a buyer right so what i'm doing is just like look at Brandon so i'm looking for you know a buyer in the network this is in New Jersey so would you go back and read we need to go share with the what the wholesaler what i would do is i would if you i would immediately ask the wholesaler again understand the exit strategies number one number three right so if the exit strategy is well i'm wholesaling you go great have you found your buyer yet right right and so step number four is here's step number four step number one review the contract step number two check state laws make sure that we're good step number three is before you um uh step number three is review the exit strategy step number four is talk to the most important person involved step number four is talk to the title company the closing attorney to make sure that they understand um what you're doing what you're accomplishing this is all before you fund the deal okay uh step number five would be fund the deal once you fill 100% secure in that transaction and then as you're in step number six step number six is what else can i bring to the table to make additional income so what Brandon talked about also what yasser's talking about yasser's double more than doubling his month no you you're lending five you're getting four back so you're essentially getting an 80 percent return on your money in a 10 day period which would probably end up being a 3000 percent or some odd return for your money it's insane okay so um the the next step would be how can i help you find a buyer and look at that as an additional benefit to your lend or to your borrower and an additional benefit to you in your pocketbook and i would pay get paid an additional jv agreement you also are if you're involved in that transaction this is what Heather and Caleb Christopher another transaction coordinators have been doing is putting themselves involved in transactions being the EMD lender or the gator lender and also putting themselves in position where they can also do the jv whole sell it um and find that buyer and make an additional chunk of money right right makes sense and i do think what you what you did with the other deal fine you know being the end buyer for it that's pretty gangster man that's yeah i think i might end up being the buyer for this deal so i you know now now we're going to be green negotiating again if i do end up finding so right that's that's a good point thank you for bringing that up i appreciate that yeah no problem you just there's so many opportunities here it's insane right and when people say i've been trying to start in a real estate and i've been trying to start in real estate for two years i'm like dude are you kidding me there are the thousands of ways to get get your hands on a transaction and i'm teaching you guys honestly one of the lowest hanging pieces of fruit in this business is just lending like lending five grand and getting four thousand dollars back holy crap if you guys can't do that go back and just work for somebody holy moly i don't know what else to tell you you can't do this this is literally a full-time business you could do it is a full-time business and it hasn't even like the thing is i've shown you guys tier one and here what i'm going to do is probably for the next month as i'll continue to teach you guys on tier one before we go to to tier two which is doing transactional funding and double closeness and stuff like that the next time we do a training guys it will not be this week it will be the week after i'll be embossed in this week for the Avengers mastermind oh that's a good one Dustin that's a good one guys listen to this Dustin had a really good one he says how about this i have a great wholesale contract to share with you you could even use my name if it carries any weight i know i'm not the most you know famous people person in the world or anything like that um but the wholesale contract so you can say hey guys uh i'm you know i pace paid for uh this wholesale contract it costs thirty two hundred dollars i've had great success with it let me know if you guys want a free version of it that's a really good one yeah i just used that yesterday pace with the wholesale uh there you go he was like i'm like hey what if i could give you a thirty two hundred dollar value for free and he was he wanted to know what happened what what it was and i was like you know let's let me send it to you and you let me know what you think and i so i sent it to him he's like holy crap i'm using this one from now on you know and there you go this is how i got this this one um what we'll be doing is i'm going to show you guys how to find these opportunities okay all so i'll tell you a couple of them right now okay number one if you are a sub two student in the side chat do you feel like you have every resource imaginable in real estate just knowing how i build my shit in our community how do you say that that's actually how i got it of course we do like oh you want to old g students you know can you help me out with this deal and then that's exactly what happens so this is this is what happens when you are a sub two student in my world is that every resource that you could even imagine has been made available to you because of this amazing community um so there's number one if you're not a sub two student then you're probably going to be missing out on the whole we are our mentorship in sub two is the most successful mentorship in real estate bar none nobody even comes remotely close and it's because of our community so that's that's number one number two if you are not a sub two student i would go to the creative finance with pace morbid Facebook group and do that but here's what's ultimately going to happen is people are going to oversaturate that Facebook group with gator lending requests so what you want to do is you want to go to your local wholesaler wholesaling Facebook groups and you want to make this post you guys listening everybody listening you guys want to listen to this post everybody ready because somebody's going to get off this and go did pace ever tell us how we can go and find these opportunities right here we go number number one here's what you do you go to a whole cellar Facebook group and you say hey my name is pace morbid there are three things of value I can provide to anybody in here hit me up anytime and you provide the three things that you provide a value okay they might change for every individual but here's what I would write okay hey guys my name is pace morbid so thank you for you know thank you for letting me into this group there's three things of value I can provide to anybody in here hit me up if you ever need anything number one what are three things of value that pace can provide me as an individual me the actual pace what can I provide it's not gator lending don't ever start out of the gate with gator lending that's that would be number three that's a third thing I can provide what are two other things I can provide there you go Daniel Rodriguez got a great one if you have lead you're having a hard time closing I'm great at communicating with sellers please hit me up I'd love to talk to your sellers that gives you an opportunity to work out dead leads now that's something my students know how to do okay number two what's another another number two hard up if it's quite up squad up or potentially tell people I have lists of sellers that if you guys want to call on them I can give those and provide those to you free of charge that's a little hook that's a little nugget you can give to people this is why I gave three hundred thousand dollars last year to my students in free list that I paid for so you guys could go out and then tell people hey I have lists in this area would you like to partner with me and that's another hook and another reason why people should send you something other people like Peter says I can underwrite I can bring brought buyers right there's a lot of things or comp a property I really like that one okay Lance William says I'm a Jerry Norton student and to be honest I have got more value out of just being around sub two students and all of your free content pace real talk thank you for being you this is this is why I can be a little bit terse sometimes in an open forum because I provide more value than anybody bar none I know it to be true and you still get people that don't appreciate it and so I think I do I will work for compliments so thank you so much for that I appreciate that so so y'all sir this is a great this is a great conversation so again let's go through this I'll you guys thought do you guys all see the individual types of levels of value that other people can say like you can comp somebody else in here is like I don't know how to comp okay well then you don't have to comp okay well you can work some of these dead leads pays I don't know how to work dead leads okay what about buying a list like I could go to pre four closures daily calm and buy a four hundred dollar four closure list and go to people in that a Facebook group local to wherever I bought that list and go hey guys I have the four closure data for this local area if you guys want to partner up on it that's there's a hundred different things you can say but you always want to say three pieces of value hey guys my name is pace morbid thank you so much for coming let me into this Facebook group there's three things that I can do for anybody in here please set me up anytime number one if you guys are generating leads and you need help closing those leads if they want too much money they don't have enough equity I'm pretty good at creative finance I'd love to help you that's number one number two if you guys need help underwriting a deal or looking at something you're unsure whether it's a good deal or it's not a good deal please hit me up I'd be happy to look at it number three if you guys are in need of micro funding such as earnest money probate expenses or other things I have been known to be a lender from time to time do not make it sound like you're a freaking lending business because that sounds clinical and salesy welcome to marketing do not sound clinical and salesy do not go I'm a lender might as well put a force field around yourself okay you guys agree with that you guys can see that stuff coming a mile away right that's super valuable that I love that hi I'm a gator lender don't do that you can tell people you learn from me you can tell people in fact if I if you were guys were smart you guys would be taking a photo of me right now on zoom and putting on your Instagram stories and tagging me and saying I'm learning how to become a gator lender so that people are aware of what you're doing and that you have the ability to gator lend to them however when you are going in Facebook groups you do not want to sound clinical and salesy because Facebook managers such as myself if somebody tries to promote something in my Facebook group freaking bury those human beings okay I have zero tolerance for anybody promoting things in my Facebook group zero tolerance I get people that DM me frequently go can you please unblock me for your Facebook group I go there's only two reasons you would have gotten blocked from my Facebook group okay one you were being aggressive and mean to people and I don't like that or two you were trying to promote some stupid stuff bye okay how would you word that you can help with transactional funding or transactional coordination I would be very on the nose about that because that's not oversaturated by any stretch of the imagination at all and you say hey guys I know how to fill out paperwork talk to sellers about questions they might have about paperwork I can coordinate your transaction so it can reach the finish line please let me know if I can help you out um Katherine how can I help you hi there um I had a quick question I um got into I inserted myself into a deal as a um a backer a credit backer basically kind of like a sponsor a sponsor yeah um and I guess what came up for me is a question of like what non-recourse loans are because I think it's a non-recourse loan except I'm just trying to understand because now you know it doesn't go into against my debt to income ratio but it it's still um I guess if they default it's still on my credit so is that really a non-recourse loan in that so this is this is a this is a really great conversation and I although I will get to this in like tier four I'll give you this as we button this down okay so the guys this is a question she's asking that has nothing to do with earnest money deposits or transactional funding or anything like that a lot of people in here are not ready for what I'm about to say and that's okay because this is the training is going to go on for several months okay Katherine the reason why I'm saying this out loud to people is because I don't want them to get shiny objects syndrome and think that any of this training has anything to do with your question your question is coming three months too early and I'm okay with that as long as everybody understands okay so never sponsor a home or a loan that you would not be okay taking over the payments and ownership of that property entirely don't do it I am not going in and are you doing it for a fee or are you doing it for ownership because I would hope that you're doing it for ownership well honestly it was for ownership um perfect and then yeah anyways for ownership okay so for its its ownership so this is a great question Katherine um it's it is Katherine right not like Katherine or anything like that okay so Katherine here's here's the way I'm doing it okay and we'll get to this level of training at some point and I'm sorry that I'm doing this in a reverse a way that I should have it's one of those things of like hey kids we're going to Disneyland at some point this summer and then all you as a child can think of is wow when are we going to Disneyland right and I've created this insatiable group of people that are like please I want to do this is this genius oh my gosh and congratulations to you on taking action I appreciate it's awesome um the challenges a lot of the training hasn't happened and so I have nowhere to reference you to go to whereas in my sub two seller finance innovation agreement training I've already built that all out and then I charge for that community and obviously that community is wildly successful I'm doing something different where I'm building this in the process and I'm not charging anything for it and I'm giving you guys live value unfortunately the excitement level forces people to want to take action and then they find themselves into the situations that you're in right now so um here's what I'm doing and I won't do a full-long answer on this but I will never sponsor a loan that I am not okay being the sole owner of if the other people default okay I am a real estate investor I want to hold properties that's part of my strategy so I look at this and I almost go man I hope these people default that's the type of loans I want to be lending on I hope you default because what I'm doing is when I sponsor the loan guess what the lender wants me to purchase it in they want me to purchase it in my entity solely 100% that property will be owned by me on paper even though my agreement will be different with to for them the person I'm sponsoring I will legally have to be forced to close on that in my LLC do you now also see why I asked you guys to sign up with PCS and get LLCs going so you guys can actually do these things some people thought oh it's pace getting an affiliate kiss my ass it's not for an affiliate it's so that you guys actually have LLCs to hold property in okay Catherine Coutos to you you're sponsoring alone I think it's one of the most gangster things you can do but what I'm doing is I will not sponsor unless I want to hold it and when you close escrow on it that property is owned entirely by your LLC 100% now after you close on that now this is where there's some deviation and some negotiation that has to happen with the person you're sponsoring for me what I am doing is I am going to hold the ownership in that of that property 100% in my name for the first year and my agreement with them is that they if they perform and they make their payments they do everything properly at the end of 12 months I will then amend the ownership of that LLC to be 30% me 70% them because they have actually shown me that they can fulfill their obligation and do their job that is how I'm protecting myself does that make sense do you have any questions about that no I mean I have one more question but I think it's related to that but no I want you to answer I'm not I will is that a still a rec a non recourse loan I guess that was my another question is like if they are checking my credit and I'm responsible is that still considered a non recourse loan is that I that's what I was trying to understand so a non recourse loan means that it's not going to go they're not going to come in to come after you with if somebody defaults okay so they're not going to come after you like a personal guarantee and they're not going to go hey Catherine you owe this debt right that's a non recourse there's there's it means there's no recourse if somebody defaults on that loan the the bank takes that property back okay and a non recourse loan doesn't mean they don't necessarily check your credit there are lenders out there that don't check your credit but most lenders are going to which gives you the gator lender the opportunity to come in with a resource that they don't have which is good credit good credentials liquidity etc and insert yourself into that deal so yes that loan is perfectly fine with me my question to you get Catherine is do you feel confident holding that property if those people default well the good news is you actually came in and now you are the owner and I still got to keep because they had already checked my credit three times so I'm actually out I'm in but I'm out and you are the yoss sponsor now but but it was just a good learning experience for me to get in and understand what the heck I was doing wait I'm the sponsor on the deal yeah now you are what's the what's the deal with Fritz oh amazing okay cool I didn't yeah I didn't know that that's great I started out as your as the sponsor but then we got a better deal for you so now you're the sponsor but they let me stay in because they'd already check my credit and document points and all that so now it's the best case you know that I'm still in and I don't have the are you so Catherine are you a little bit fearful of having your name on alone no I just really was trying to I like I would have been totally fine with it um like because it was the perfect situation I just wanted to understand because I thought we were getting non-recourse loans but so then I didn't understand wall but like they needed to check a credit so I didn't understand why I would still be responsible for it if it if it wasn't on the title the type of loan that we're talking about here is called a ninja loan right non-income no doc loan right a lot a lot of stuff and those those exist now they've existed for a couple of years where you can get alone with with only income statements okay they're not they don't check your credit they don't check your taxes history they literally will just go up based off of loan docs so that would be like a full loan that's like no credit pull okay and those exist but most lenders don't go that route they want to do a soft poll on your credit they want to actually have some sort of security um you know those types of things and then the worst case scenario is if that loan defaults it doesn't actually go against you in a negative manner it just goes back to the bank that's what non-recourse really means in that situation okay so technically that one isn't non-recourse long it was okay yep okay that makes sense yeah um I'm sorry that I ended up coming in and being coming in a sponsor I'll end up being coming like 30 Maryland and Abby says we have a lot to learn guess can I tell you something Maryland and Abby so do I I don't know everything I'm learning things every single day the greatest part about real estate is that the learning never stops it's like it's a video game that just keeps on going and going and you just got to learn that this is part of the process is feeling overwhelmed and feeling like oh my gosh I'm be anybody in here feel like they're a little bit behind they're like oh my gosh I don't know what 30% of what came out of pace is mouth meant this is full immersion this is how you actually change your life not being a little baby that eats these little nibbles and goes okay all right today I'm going to spend three hours learning what ARV means guys full immersion I try here's the funny thing is I tried to learn Korean for three months in United States and I learned how to say hello how are you and I learned how to say a prayer when I went to Korea it took me about a week to learn a hundred times more because I had nothing I had no ability to say anything but Korean so get overwhelmed feel comfortable with being overwhelmed and understand that that's not just okay but it is a requirement to be overwhelmed when you're learning okay in fact I should make that a t-shirt over me over being overwhelmed is a requirement it truly is in part of learning everything okay it's just everybody getting value today did everybody have a paradigm shift minds open hundred thousand dollar plus value okay good work guys can you see that this is like crazy level value of training that I just gave you better than all of the other gator lending stuff combined like we're actually starting to move forward I'm rewarding you guys for taking action so great job amazing amazing stuff taking action this is what you get

Pace morby bro good to see you thanks for coming back on the channel I think you are my favorite guest to have on the 
Channel people love you this is my favorite channel of all time this is where what do you think I learned wholesaling where do you learn thing I 
learned flipping where do you think I learned raising money this is the greatest Channel ever man thank you for taking time guys we're gonna do 
something really special we're going to create an entire series on creative financing and I think we're going to 
make probably I don't know 10 12 videos in this series I think when we put this all together as a playlist it's going to 
be everything and anything you could ever want to know about creative financing and there's no better time 
than right now for you to know this not just now but for the next probably 48 months these strategies will dominate 
they will change your life if you're a real estate agent if you're a flipper if you're a wholesaler these things will double triple or quadruple your income 
just by knowing these strategies and so Jerry had a great idea of doing a playlist starting from a going all the 
way through Z and whatever question you guys have in the comments please make a comment down below like I don't 
understand this I need more information on this because the next time Jerry and I hang out we're going to do another set 
of videos based on your questions love that and pace you're so right you know creative is always a good strategy no 
matter what's going on but you just mentioned right now as of this recording for the next couple years because we're 
going to be seeing High interest rates and interest rates are going to greatly affect people's ability to to get 
capital for deals which means if you can take over existing financing if you can leverage that already into deals it's 
going to be Game Changer I mean it's really going to make a big difference so that's why this is so relevant right now I told somebody in analogy the other day 
I said if you go to play golf against Tiger Woods he's going to beat you no matter what right we got that but 
showing up um in a real estate transaction is like showing up to play Tiger Woods and you only have a putter 
right like you need all the clubs in your bag in order to compete with anybody and so these strategies it's not 
that we're teaching you a completely different game it's that we're adding new tools to an existing game right so 
people go man I want to focus on whole selling I want to focus on this guys creative finance will amplify your game it will give you all the clubs you need 
in your bag to go play a complete round of golf essentially in real estate and give you a Fighting Chance we've got we 
both buy a lot of deals where other people couldn't make them work wholesalers go hey Jerry I got a deal I 
don't know what to do with it has no equity okay well I look at that deal and I go I want it Jerry looks at the deal goes I want it you just got to know how 
to utilize those clubs in the bag so this series is going to show you all of those clubs and in the proper order and 
let's start from there because I think uh most of the people that watch the channel Pace as you know are wholesalers 
a lot of people working on their first deal and one of the basic things we learn is making all cash offer and so 
when you make an all-cash offer that cash that's going to come in and take down that deal whether it's your cash or 
a cash buyer's cash new capital for a deal there is a cost to that money and 
that cost of that money is very expensive because that money could be doing something else for somebody so to 
bring new New Capital into a deal means you need the biggest discount on the property 
how is that different first first of all kind of big picture how is that different when you leverage any of these 
creative financing strategies so what's great about creative Finance is that people go man you're you're such a 
wizard you're so amazing you're this that and the other guys I can tell you one thing before we jump into this and answer that question out of everybody I 
know that talks about creative finances as a main strategy of theirs Jerry you know more about creative finance and 
guys that have been teaching creative Finance for 30 40 years right like you do very creative strategy so I'm so 
excited about this this whole entire series very very pumped hope you guys are excited too so with um with capital 
if I go into an appointment okay when I was just doing wholesale like seven eight years ago I would go into an 
appointment knowing house is worth two hundred thousand dollars after it's all the way fixed up that means I got to pay 
110 to 130 depending on the condition of the property so I gotta I gotta get the seller all 
the way down there and based on the convenience maybe I give them or the speed or them avoiding going through a 
real estate agent that is worth it to that seller but more often than not I was running into sellers saying dude are 
you kidding me you're gonna give me 50 cents on the dollar sixty cents on the dollar of what my house could be worth no thank you I'm just going to fix it up 
myself in fact I think it's maybe like five percent actually fall into that camp where they're willing to take that 
huge discount and that cash is just we'll they'll trade all that equity for 
the convenience of cash right and this is where people come to me and they go I think wholesale is where I should start 
I go well first off you can wholesale creative Finance deals and we'll get to that but second off I think creative 
Finance is actually way easier than wholesale and the number one reason why is because we can pay way more money 
without actually coming out of pocket or without even borrowing money from a hard money lender or a private private money 
lender and the reason being is because the seller already has the debt secured 
and financed and approved in their name so in order for me to 
deep like deep dive them down to 50 cents on the dollar I gotta undercut everything they owe on that mortgage 
guys just it's I can pay 80 cents 90 cents sometimes a hundred cents on the dollar win that appointment whereas when 
you're a wholesaler all you're doing is going in and going I gotta lowball this person 50 60 cents which one do you 
think is easier lowballing 50 60 cents on the dollar or coming up to where the seller either owes or giving the seller 
the number they need as long as they give you creative Finance terms which we'll talk about in a minute I've heard you say it does not make sense to take 
out existing debt with new debt meaning bringing New Capital to take out already 
existing Capital that's in place on that property one of my most viral YouTube shorts was a seller call I had and I had 
a seller go wait so you're not going to pay off my loan and I go nope I'm not going to pay off your loan and she says 
why wouldn't you pay off my loan and I said why would I pay off your loan because I have to go get a loan over 
here a fresh brand new loan that just started over to pay off this loan that 
you've already had in place the only people that make any money in that transaction are two different banks and a bunch of loan officers and escrow 
officers make all the money you don't make the money and I don't make the money so why don't we just work out a deal directly where I can take over the 
existing debt and make you win and me win last thing about creative Finance is 
that again I think it's the only strategy that is a strategy where both 
parties completely win in wholesale I'm a wholesaler too so I'm not knocking wholesale I'm just saying creative 
Finance gives you additional tools the seller wins by getting a higher price 
in wholesale the seller wins by getting convenience and so there is a place for both of those but I find that there's 
more opportunities in my world because I have a different set of glasses that I'm wearing I see more creative Finance 
opportunities than I do see wholesale and keep in mind we're going to be covering this quite a bit but keep in 
mind it's not so much wholesaling it's not so much the cash offer when it comes to 
wholesaling because you can also wholesale these creative Finance deals in fact when you when you structure 
create a finance deal with a seller and let's say that you don't want to keep that deal it's not it's not the right 
time for you you want to wholesale it and that's awesome make some cash wholesale it when you take that creative Finance deal to a another investor who 
does see a use maybe they want to hold it and rent it or whatever they want to do with it they will pay a premium for 
that deal because you've created an opportunity where they don't have to come up with a lot of cash to get into 
the deal the biggest assignment fee I've ever paid in my life was on a creative Finance deal was a 210 000 assignment 
fee I paid as the buyer and I gave that to a wholesaler who'd never done a 
creative Finance deal in his life and he's like are you kidding me the biggest wholesale check I ever got was 15 grand you just paid me two hundred and ten 
thousand dollars here's the deal the deal was a seller 30 units in Texas Apartment Complex seller was ready to 
retire his name's mark real and Mario says I want my number I don't care what you guys offer me I want my number I've 
owned this property for 20 years I'm not budging at all so the um wholesaler goes he's motivated he 
wants to sell he wants to retire he doesn't want to have tenants anymore but I don't know what to do this guy I got to offer him 1.7 million dollars in 
order to wholesale this yeah and I go let me talk to the seller and if I can get the seller to sell that three 
million dollars to me and let me make payments to him with no money down then I'll buy it for 3 million which is his 
asking price and I'll pay you what I told him I said I'll pay you a percentage I'll take the my cash flow 
and I'll multiply it by 10 and that'll be your assignment fee my cash flow on that property is twenty one thousand 
dollars a month and so I go I I offered him 10 times my my cash flow I'll pay 
you in an assignment fee up front and so we worked out the deal the seller gave me three million dollars no money down 
four percent interest and 50 years to pay the payment 50 years with no balloon 
payment and some of you guys don't know what a balloon is but we're going to go into a lot of the stuff in the series coming up so there's been some 
terminology some little examples we've gone through really quickly but this series is going to be fun because we'll take a little bit more time give these 
strategies a little bit more breath where do I find them where are they coming from how do I handle the paperwork where do I go to get help 
those types of things this is going to be a lot of fun yeah so to end this video maybe let's just list off seven or 
eight of the main strategies that we're going to cover in this series we'll then Deep dive so watch watch for these next 
videos to come out because we're going to really go into each one and full circle it we're going to talk about ways 
to acquire that type of a strategy when it fits how to structure it how to know what to pay for it what your what Your 
dispos strategies could be all of it but first the the very next video we're 
going to actually go into these instruments some of this terminology because you cannot really do well with 
creative financing if you don't understand how the instruments work you got to have the vocab fabulary you 
really need to understand how to structure before you can really do creative financing well yeah and the thing I 
think people like about um the way I teach creative Finance is that I'm not that smart and so when I 
listen to other people teach creative Finance I'm like you guys make my brain just want to quit over complicated over 
complicated they use terminology in words that don't make sense to the normal human being so what we'll do is 
I'll talk about creative Finance in everyday life that pertains to every strategy so like the way my mom used to 
build her sewing business she actually did it through creative finance and I'll tie that in tell you guys really good stories you can understand at a very 
high level what these things are without having to like get your brains melted which is so important because if you 
can't explain it to your seller and you confuse the seller you just killed your deal killed your deal and sellers again 
guys when we're talking about creative Finance seller finance sub 2 blah blah blah wraps notes Deeds of trust none of 
these things I actually ever say to the sellers and neither this Jerry I watch a lot of his seller calls we tell stories 
and we get people to understand everyday situations so we're gonna have a lot of fun with this so 
let's say that I'm a wholesaler right because a lot of people on your channel are wholesalers I'm generating leads I'm 
either cold calling I'm texting I'm sending out postcards whatever it is leads are coming in here's what I found 
okay I found the average wholesaler has to look at about 40 to 50 leads in order 
to get one wholesale deal is that kind of the average yeah that sounds about right okay so our acquisition team is 40 
to 50 to get one cash deal but I can take that exact same set of late leads 
and utilizing this list we're going to Rattle off right now I can get another four deals out of those same 50 leads so 
think about that pace people are spending thousands of dollars in marketing looking for that low cash 
offer scenario that five percent motivated seller willing to take that big discount what you're saying is out 
of that throw away that money you've spent that now you're basically throwing away you've got four more deals in that 
same list that is getting discarded by most wholesalers yeah um isn't that incredible this may be an analogy Jerry 
doesn't want me to put on his YouTube channel but let's say you show up to a party and there's a bunch of guys and a bunch of girls and there's like five 
percent of the girls in there really beautiful they dress well they did their hair they wore their makeup and they're 
there to to look for a date I don't necessarily want to always go 
after that five percent because guess where all the other men are everybody else is competing for the same five 
percent so for me as I look around the room and I go oh hey that deal over 
there or that real estate transaction or maybe that girl in my world all she does she's missing a dress I'm 
going to give her a nice dress oh my gosh that's the most beautiful world woman in the world so you just got to 
look at things and realize that the value is not on the surface a lot of times the value could be in the 
individual deal and we're going to talk about how to undercover uncover that value and how to make money on that 
value so that you walk into a room everybody else is competing on the five percent wholesale deals I don't have to 
compete I just have to be creative in my thinking and I think I think the biggest mindset shift that has to happen with 
creative financing is to stop looking at Price you know as cash when we do cash 
buyers and wholesalers that are thinking cash only type of transactions it's all 
about the price whereas one of the things you teach is with creative it's not about the price it's about the use 
right I tell people the future value of that use right so people go well how can 
you do that how can you pay at that price and I go because the value of a of a house in cash transactions is what you 
could sell it for to a family but in Creative Finance the value of the transaction is what you can do with it 
right the value of the use like Jerry just said so I don't look at the purchase price in fact when I underwrite 
a creative Finance deal the purchase price is like the fifth thing I look at the first thing I look at is what can it 
produce me in income versus what will it cost me on a monthly basis and I figure out my spread and then I figure out 
number two how much is this going to require for me to bring maybe a partner to the table or whatever we can talk 
about that later we could do a whole video on how to underwrite a creative Finance deal totally and the process we go through yeah but I think guys the the 
whole point here with why we're doing this series is when you spend money on 
marketing or when you get on the phone with an agent or a seller you want to have all the tools in your toolbox to 
take advantage of each and every lead Paces goal my goal is on every appointment walk out of there with a 
deal and the more you understand creative the more you can structure these amazing deals and if you don't want them wholesale them but you've got 
to be able to become a full full service acquisition engineer to really do this business well especially with how much 
it's costing now to do marketing and to get in front of sellers right there's right we when I jumped into the business 
probably very similar to Jerry is that when you were doing only cash transactions you realize the most 
important kpi that I followed key performance indicator like the the measurement of success in my business 
um was cost per contract okay so I would go spend money on marketing let's say ten thousand dollars in postcards for 
three months and if I got one contract in three months that means that one contract cost me ten thousand dollars so 
my cost per contract was very very high in that scenario so I got really good Acquisitions and 
running the business I was watching flipping Mastery just FYI make sure you guys subscribe so as I was learning 
those things and learning how to be really good at cash but then I was like man how do I get my cost per contract 
down well the answer is take those exact same leads and figure out how to get creative with those and my cost per 
contract would go from ten thousand dollars a contract down to fifteen hundred dollars a contract because I could have five contracts per set of 
leads rather than just one so that's what we're going to be showing you guys today and and let's start with the list 
what are the other strategies I can use besides just offering let's talk about that seven or eight main there's lots I 
think you've I've saw you list off like one time 27 or whatever 27 different strategies let's stick to the maybe the 
top seven that people can that we're going to cover in this series and subsequent videos and really deep dive 
those seven or eight top ones so okay one of the wrong ones number one's got to be seller finance okay it's commonly 
known it's actually written in all the real estate tracks it's legally written in so many like every every state has a 
seller carry back addendum for real estate agents so even real estate agents know you can find seller finance deals 
on landwatch.com there's 11 700 listings right now on landwatch.com for seller 
finance very common some of the other names are owner carry owner financing seller financing there's another one 
that was really I forgot seller carry back uh Keller carry back yeah seller carry back 
um installment sale okay installment sales that's kind of an older School methodology uh seller 
finance um creative Finance whatever or owner 
Financial owner finance seller finance those are synonymous of each other but big picture seller is the bank right 
seller is the bank so here is the reason you'll run into a lead right a lead 
comes into my system whether I'm cold calling texting whatever typically seller finance is the seller 
is looking for too high of a price okay I call this um gain they are looking for gain they 
don't care about anything else they don't typically have pain so these are the sellers you're on the phone with that are like no I'm not budging on my 
price yes I'm selling I need to go downgrade upgrade I'm moving out of state whatever but no I'm not budging on 
price so the number one thing they care about is price and so in seller finance we can we can pay the seller's price as 
long as they'll allow us to make payments on that price rather than go and get cash to give it all to them at 
the same time yeah so seller finance I'd say is number one most common we'll start with that in video number big thing to remember is they have no debt 
on the property no debt on the property so they own It Free and Clear which by the way I didn't realize this but 30 of 
all real estate owned is free and clear it's Bonkers when you drive around your town and you realize that one or yeah 
one out of every three and a half houses that you drive by or three out of ten 
you're like off yeah free and clear paid off like that's how amazing the 
opportunity with seller finances so that's number one we'll do that that'll be the next video no that'll be video 
number three yep because the video we're gonna do instruments and terminology some people work all that stuff 
um number two what happens when a seller owes too much money on the property and they can't sell the property because 
there's no equity that would be subject too and we're going to see more and more of that coming up it's overwhelming um for me 
this is how common creative Finance is I've turned off all cash Acquisitions for the next 24 months people DM me they 
text me they email me they go peace here's a great cash deal go I'm not looking at Cash I'm so overwhelmed right 
now with sub two opportunities the opportunities are so so big it's overwhelming and here let's I'll give 
you a typical person somebody that's in foreclosure right they have lack of equity or the property needs a little 
bit of work and they don't want to go through a real estate agent or it didn't sell on the market or whatever and this 
is crazy because here's what's happening in Maricopa County where you used to live I live now we had 3 000 listings on 
the MLS in January we now have 23 000 listings less than 10 months later so 
huge inventory Spike right inventory Spike days on Market have gone way way High real estate agents can't sell 
houses it's it's crazy what about the people that got loans last year that want to sell three percent four 
percent whatever in the last couple of years that now we're trying to sell and the Market's already dipped 10 it's going to dip another 10 15 over the next 
24 months there's millions of opportunities that you guys can do so many things with that just a cash offer 
will never suffice so because they're upside down they upside down oh more than the market will pay right or really 
close to what the market will pay and it just doesn't justify the time or energy for them to get a real estate agent 
involved yeah and some of them are listed some of them are listed they're sitting because they're trying to sell it for 80 000 because they need to pay 
commissions and closing fees and pay off the mortgage and it's sitting because the market wants to pay seventy thousand 
right and so it doesn't sell I mean this is a whole video by itself is that people misconstrue the word equity and 
spread so if I owe two if I have a house that's worth two hundred thousand dollars but I owe 190 and I ask you how 
much Equity does that person have right they owe 190 to the bank house is worth 200 how much Equity do they have people 
go oh it's ten thousand no it's not incorrect Equity is the amount of money you have in your pocket after you've 
sold your house and everybody's been paid so in that situation that person has about a negative 10 000 Equity but 
it'll cost them about 20 grand to sell the house I call it Phantom Equity because it's like fake Equity it's not real Equity It's Paper Equity right but 
when you actually do the transaction there are all the fees involved and sellers just aren't educated on that when you when you acquire your property 
you're not told hey just so you know when you go to sell this house in five years or seven years which is the average amount of time people stay in a 
house you're gonna have to pay about 10 percent of the sales price to commissions closing costs inspections 
home warranties escrow Title Insurance blah blah blah blah all that kind of stuff and sometimes your Buy buyers will 
ask you the seller to pay down their interest rate on their loan so Pace when 
when the seller has an existing loan on the property we call that sub 2 or subject two meaning subject to existing 
financing that's the creative financing strategy sub two subject two right that's number that's the second one on 
your list what's the third one third one is hybrid so hybrid what happens when you have a seller who houses worth 200 
they owe 100 on the property to let's say Chase right they have a bank a bank 
loan with Chase that means they have a hundred thousand dollar spread that you as the Newbie somebody new in the 
business goes how do I pay that hundred thousand dollars and then take over their existing payment well we you don't 
we actually create an agreement between you and the seller so it's half sub two half seller finance the first position 
note and we'll talk about this in the next videos first position second position first position is a sub two 
second position with Chase and the second position is directly with the seller and whatever agreement you 
work out with them this could be a variety of 25 different ways but one could be I make small payments to them 
most of the time when I do a hybrid hybrid I tell the seller I'll take over your existing payments with Chase and 
I'm not going to make any payments on your hundred thousand dollars for five years but once five years is up I'll 
either have refinanced the house sold the house or I'll start making payments yep so a hybrid between seller financing 
and subject to combining the two that's the third one fourth one fourth one lease options lease options lease 
options been around for a very very long time I did leash lease options heavy for about three years there are some 
downfalls to lease options while there are also some major upsides and we'll talk about that in the lease options 
video coming up but lease option is where I go to the seller and I literally create a two document contract with them 
one is a lease where I'm the tenant and the other document is an option that says I have the option to buy this 
property at a a very specific purchase price at a very specific date in the future or sooner 
that I can lock in today so the value for me is I go to the seller and I go 
hey I'd like to buy your house on seller finance or sub 2. sometimes sellers go no I don't know that I trust you 
entirely right I don't run into this here's why I did a lot of lease options I wasn't great at negotiating when I 
first started and so lease options were really great for somebody that was brand new that was not real I didn't have 
flipping Mastery when I started okay I couldn't watch negotiation videos and watch actual seller calls so I would 
jump into lease options as kind of a crutch that I go to the seller and go well if you don't trust me to take over 
your mortgage or you don't trust me to do a seller finance why don't I do a lease with you show you that I'm worthy 
of this relationship and then give me the option to buy it from you at a very fixed price in the future yeah and there 
are some downsides we'll cover that when we get to these options but one of the great things is it obligates the seller 
who who now cannot sell that property so you buy some time it helps you buy some 
time because now you have the option the buy but the seller cannot sell to somebody else the cool thing about lease 
options too that people don't realize is I can do I can wholesale a lease options I can do a sandwich lease option where I 
acquire a lease option and then I can do a lease option to the next person so I'm technically in the deal no money out of 
pocket every one of these strategies we're going to talk about you can be into them no money you can also do a master lease or you call Arbitrage we'll 
talk about that's one of your seven is an intercept rate okay you could also do that from a lease option it's amazing 
absolutely amazing lease options are they're very flexible there's people like John Jackson are you friends with John Jackson John Jackson teaches that's 
all he teaches lease options it's that big of an opportunity is that one strategy there's people that literally teach nothing but lease options because 
of how diverse and Powerful it is okay so lease option was that four I think that was four okay next one uh next one 
would be um let's do Arbitrage so Master Lease right so what I like about 
Arbitrage is you get tenants or I'm sorry not tenants but you get landlords that have 
listed properties for rent you can go to them and instead of convincing them to sell the property to you you just go hey 
I'll pay you your rent as long as you let me turn into an Airbnb uh so I have a I have an Arbitrage deal that's a 
sober living a thing makes me like two thousand dollars a month and I did it off of one call I had a student that 
goes hey um I don't see you do a lot of Arbitrage are they that easy I go bro let's do it right now literally called 
off a Craigslist rental ad called the guy I go hey will you let me just release this out he goes no problem as 
long as you this is what I told him I go I'm going to turn into a sober living facility he goes okay well my rent is 
1200 if you pay me 1500 I don't care what you do with the property so it's the ability to sublease sublease so you 
have a Master Lease with the seller and in that contract it says you have the ability to then release it for other 
uses that that seller's not willing to do like Airbnb or what you said is soberly so it gives you that flexibility 
to to then to make more money than the lease you're paying directly to the seller right and so the on that sober 
living facility for example I gave the seller in the master lease or the Arbitrage situation I gave him he had 
1200 rent I paid him 1500 so he's getting an inflated payment he let me have three months of no 
payments and what I did is I took the silver living facility they paid me ten thousand dollars as their security 
deposit which I was able to take non-refundable right because they're gonna whatever and then I rented it to 
them for twenty four hundred dollars a month yeah so I'm making nine hundred dollars a month because they need a place to put their sober living tenants 
and they're being paid by the government that's like almost guaranteed money so 900 a month on that one house there's 
two houses on the same property so I'm making roughly um between the two I'm making about two thousand bucks a month yeah there's some 
downsides because you don't you don't get any upside in equity but it's a zero down strategy which is really cool no 
money out basically if you structure it right you get paid today yeah like in your case you got the ten thousand and 
cash flow every month with no money out of pocket it might be like if you if you put Jerry on a park bench in the middle 
of Omaha Nebraska and you said Jerry go go make money today like check in your pocket today and Arbitrage would be a 
really great way to do that he could just call a rental and then he could find a sober living facility and go hey if you pay me me a five thousand dollar 
security deposit today I'll hold your spot on this rental you can make five thousand dollars today through an 
Arbitrage situation this Mass release is a huge strategy in Puerto Rico because there's a real shortage in Hospitality 
so Airbnb is really popular so what a lot of investors do is they'll do the Master Lease then they'll just turn 
around an Airbnb it because the demand's so high and they'll double triple their money from what they're paying in their 
Master Lease a really great outfit like example of what you don't know is costing you a lot 
of money yeah totally like you're spending money on leads you're cold calling you're doing all this kind of stuff you'll get frustrated running into 
sellers that you can't solve their problem because you don't have these tools like it's powerful what we've 
talked about so far let's do now executory executory contracts so executory contract is a very top level 
description of it's the legal term of it but depending on the state you're in Arizona is called an agreement for sale 
Michigan land contract Michigan land contract you've got pencil Vania is bond for deed summer contract for deed 
contract for deed there's actually 14 different names for an executory contract depending on which of the 50 
states you're in okay here's what it means when you are working with a seller 
a seller will say yeah I'll I'll sell or Finance to you or I'll let 
you take over my existing Chase payment but I don't trust you to fail on the 
payments I you might fail in the payments and so you can go executory contract comes in handy when you say 
well no problem why don't you hold the deed or the ownership in escrow to 
protect me from ever for getting foreclosed on or having to be foreclosed on so protects a seller in that situation gives us the seller security 
so if you have a seller that goes I would sell to you on seller finance but I'm not sure of you you go oh let's do a 
contract for deed I want to retain title right or hold it in escrow right and 
then another way it helps you is when people are really afraid of the do on sale clause which we'll talk about in 
future videos when people are afraid of the do on sale Clause I offer that to them or their attorney or their their 
real estate agent I go well we could do a bond for deed or a contract for deed in agreement for sale remember those are all the exact same thing it just depends 
on the state you're in we could do an executory contract and they go oh wow that solves every problem in the book 
another one is where executory contracts come in handy is I have a sub 2 deal 
Instagram shut down my account for this I did an IG live on it a couple days ago and I named my address 6001 East 
um it's a big No-No now blah blah blah yeah okay so I named the address we're not going to name it now we're not going to name it now so I had an agent that 
had a listed property seller had bought the property last year with a VA loan which means what how much money did he 
put down zero was the zero so the a loans are zero down so he how much Equity does he have guys he has no zero 
so when he goes to sell the property guess what agent tells them you're gonna have to come out of pocket and he goes 
okay well figure it out you're the agent figure it out so the agent actually reached out to us and said I know you do 
all this creative stuff is there a way I can get paid my commissions which is a common question in Creative Finance how 
does the agent get paid in fact don't even think about doing creative Finance with agents unless you're gonna be 
figuring out their Commission because they're not going to be motivated to work your deal if they can't get paid right and if you are reaching out to an 
agent we'll talk to you guys about that in some future videos about how to reach out to them where these deals come from but the common thing I say to an agent 
is if I can get your commissions paid would your seller be open to blah blah blah blah right you want to get them 
paid so this agent reaches out to us we get under contract we open escrow we 
find out the seller has a down payment assistance program that helped pay for 
his furniture and his move-in costs on this loan yeah so the talk about zero down literally he 
got this guy's got paid to buy talk about creative Finance dang man become a become a veteran holy crap so he gets 
all he gets payment all the stuff paid for but the terms of that down payment assistance program says that he can't 
sell the property for five years without a penalty so he goes well the deal's done I go no 
it's not we're going to do an executory contract where I will own the property but the deed or the ownership which 
we'll talk about in the next video did not transfer did not transfer insta instead it sits in a safety deposit 
perfect example yeah and that I won the deal that deal with cash flow it's an amazing opportunity for me and nobody 
else could have solved that the real estate agent got paid commissions um they the agent actually brought it to 
a wholesaler wholesaler brought it to me so two people got paid on that transaction and I bought the deal using 
an executory contract that people don't even know about yeah it's crazy awesome so that's I think was that six or seven 
seven maybe I forget what number one remember that's number six we got one maybe more okay maybe and maybe we'll throw in a couple of really cool ones 
like the morbi method yeah dating contractor one of those morbi method I would say number seven so let's say you 
have a seller that has a house paid off free and clear seller finance and the seller says I 
want a massive down payment okay well I'm brand new I yeah I don't have 50 Grand or 50 Grand what are you 
talking about so the morbi method is a strategy where you go to a bank or like 
there's companies like myinvestor loan.com there's companies out there that will give you 50 60 debt and or 
could it be private money could be private money yeah okay it could be private money or a partner or whatever you give the seller half of the money 
down and then the seller gives you a seller finance for the other 50 down right so I've got a deal right now it's 
in um Lafayette Louisiana 105 unit multi-family deal 11 million dollar deal 
what I did is seller says all seller finance it to you but I want 50 down I 
go okay no problem so I went to my bank they didn't look at me as the individual 
they looked at the deal and they gave me half of the money based on the deal that 
half the money went to the seller and then the seller let me have a second note in a note between the seller 
promissory note where I could make the seller payments that start in five years so I'm literally about I just bought 105 
unit apartment complex with no money out of my pocket Bank gave me 50 the seller 
let me make payments on the other 50 so it's it's uh seller financing the down payment while leveraging some Bank 
financing or other financing that a lot of times doesn't require your credit at all very cool okay I think those are is 
there any others or those the main ones we wanted those are the main ones okay those are the main ones guys so now watch for this series where we're gonna 
roll out individual videos that are going to break down each of those strategies again we're gonna go full 
circle in the technology and very important part of this is that remember these Tyler's waving at us saying this 
video has gone very long YouTube YouTube hates long videos um so make some comments down below make 
sure that the algorithm you punch the algorithm right in the face with some comments and some likes because we want to do a little bit longer video on some 
of these stuff but here's what we didn't talk about on these strategies these are how we acquire properties inside of these

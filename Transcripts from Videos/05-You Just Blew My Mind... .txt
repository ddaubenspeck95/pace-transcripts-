 I'm saying what I'm saying is I would bring a lender to the table. Your lender's your lender's not going to give you 1.8 million, right? No, no, no, no, no. So what I'm saying is the lender comes to to you and says, hey, let's do a cash out refi, right? And he gives you a loan for a million. So out of that million, he gives you the 300 for your first that's paid off. He gives you the 300 for your second that's paid off. And now you have a remaining $400,000 in cash, right? Right. But then that means that you have $800,000 in additional equity. So what I'm saying is you take the $400,000 in cash, I make the payments on your new million dollar loan and I make you payments towards your $800,000 in equity. You just blew my mind. I'm trying to write this down. Okay, so what is what is what is Uncle Sam going to hit me for? Well, if you do a cash out refi, that's tax-free income, right? So you're essentially you took out a loan. So what we would do is we'd have a conversation with my CPA and we'd structure in a way that you don't get hit like all at once, right? And that's the challenge, right? Anytime you're making money, you're going to get hit with something. So we all we have to do as a team is mitigate that that hit.

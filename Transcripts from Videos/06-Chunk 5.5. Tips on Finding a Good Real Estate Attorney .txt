 All right. Brandon Smith, I have you next. I just had a quick question as far as finding the correct attorney to review these. I live in Louisiana. We have a lot of old French law here. I just wanted to ensure I was covered before I actually did anything. Is your private Facebook group? Is that a good place to look? Yeah, that is a good place to look. Unfortunately, I don't believe I have a good reference, unfortunately, for Louisiana. I might have somebody for Alabama, but that doesn't do any good. It's close, but no cigar, right? So, yeah, you may have to just post something in there and see, post something in the creative financing group and see if they do. I know there's, you know, transaction coordinators as well that are, you know, listening in and maybe they have some people that they use in Louisiana. So, yeah, you're just going to have a look at that. Just saw Tammy's post. Okay. Perfect. Excellent. I reached out to one here and he didn't even want to look at the contract because he didn't write it. So, I'll feel like, okay, never mind. So, yeah. There's stuffy lawyers out there. What? You mean not everyone like Johnson's a player? That's crazy, guys. All right. So, Brandon, thank you for your question.
